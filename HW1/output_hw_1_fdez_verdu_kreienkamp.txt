COUNCIL JOINT ACTION 2005/889/CFSP
of 12 December 2005
on establishing a European Union Border Assistance Mission for the Rafah Crossing Point (EU BAM Rafah)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 14 and the third subparagraph of Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

The European Union, as part of the Quartet, is committed to assisting and facilitating the implementation of the Roadmap, which lays out reciprocal steps by the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority in the political, security, economic, humanitarian, and institution-building fields, that will result in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.


(2)

Following Israel’s unilateral disengagement from Gaza, the Government of Israel is no longer present at the Rafah Crossing Point and the terminal is closed apart from exceptional cases.


(3)

The European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004 reaffirmed the readiness of the EU to support the Palestinian Authority in taking responsibility for law and order, and in particular, in improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity.


(4)

The Council of 7 November 2005 reiterated the EU’s support for the work of the Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, and welcomed his recent report to members of the Quartet. The Council also noted his letter of 2 November 2005 in which he requested on behalf of the parties that the EU consider playing a Third Party monitoring role at the Rafah Crossing Point on the Gaza-Egypt border. The Council noted the EU’s willingness in principle to provide assistance with the operation of crossings at Gaza’s border on the basis of an agreement between the parties.


(5)

The opening of the Rafah Crossing Point has economic, security and humanitarian implications.


(6)

The EU has identified as a priority the building up of a Palestinian customs administration in EC-Palestinian cooperation. The Community has provided assistance to the Palestinian border management and has an established tripartite dialogue on customs issues with the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority is engaged in developing detailed plans for border security procedures with the support of the USA and Israel.


(7)

On 24 October 2005 the Palestinian Prime Minister sent a letter to the European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy in which he requested the EC’s assistance in such areas as capacity building of Palestinian personnel at the Rafah crossing point, the development and installation of needed systems and equipment, and providing advice and support of Palestinian officials on duty at the Rafah Crossing Point.


(8)

On 15 November 2005 the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority concluded an Agreement on Movement and Access at border crossing points with Gaza, which, inter alia, indicated the role of the EU as a third party regarding the operation of the relevant crossing points.


(9)

In letters of invitation, on 20 November 2005 and on 23 November 2005 respectively, the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel invited the EU to establish a European Union Border Assistance Mission for the Rafah Crossing Point (EU BAM Rafah).


(10)

The European Union mission will be complementary and will bring added value to current international efforts, as well as develop synergies with ongoing European Community and Member States efforts. The mission will seek coherence and coordination with the capacity-building actions of the Community, notably in the domain of customs administration.


(11)

The mission will be set in the wider context of the EU and of the international community’s effort to support the Palestinian Authority in taking responsibility for law and order, and in particular, in improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity.


(12)

Appropriate liaison with the European Union Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories, referred to as the European Union Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (EUPOL COPPS) (1), should be ensured.


(13)

The mission will implement its mandate in the context of a situation which poses a threat to law and order, the security and safety of individuals, and to the stability of the area and which could harm the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy as set out in Article 11 of the Treaty.


(14)

Security is a prime and continuing concern and appropriate arrangements to ensure security should be adopted.


(15)

In conformity with the guidelines of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 to 9 December 2000, this Joint Action should determine the role of the Secretary-General/High Representative, in accordance with Articles 18 and 26 of the Treaty.


(16)

Article 14(1) of the Treaty calls for the indication of a financial reference amount for the whole period of implementation of the Joint Action. The indication of amounts to be financed by the Community budget illustrates the will of the political authority and is subject to the availability of commitment appropriations during the respective budget year,

COUNCIL JOINT ACTION 2005/797/CFSP
of 14 November 2005
on the European Union Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 14 and the third subparagraph of Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

The European Union, as part of the Quartet, is committed to assisting and facilitating the implementation of the Roadmap, which lays out reciprocal steps by the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority in the political, security, economic, humanitarian, and institution building fields, that will result in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.


(2)

The European Council of 17 and 18 June 2004 reaffirmed the readiness of the EU to support the Palestinian Authority in taking responsibility for law and order, and in particular, in improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity.


(3)

The European Union Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support was formally established by an Exchange of Letters on 20 April 2005 between the Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and the EU Special Representative to the Middle-East Peace Process Marc Otte.


(4)

The General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 July 2005 reiterated the EU commitment to contributing to the development of Palestinian security capacity through the Palestinian Civil Police, in coordination with the US Security Coordinator. It also agreed in principle that EU support to the Palestinian Civil Police should take the form of an European Security and Defence Policy mission building on the work of the EU Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support in cooperation with all the parties concerned.


(5)

The follow-on to the EU Coordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support is an expression of the EU continued readiness to support the Palestinian Authority in complying with its Roadmap obligations, in particular with regard to ‘security’ and ‘institution-building’, including the process of consolidating the Palestinian security organisations into three services reporting to an empowered Palestinian Minister of Interior. Furthermore, the support of the EU to the Palestinian Civil Police aims at increasing the ‘safety and security’ of the Palestinian population and at serving the domestic agenda of the Palestinian Authority in reinforcing the rule of law.


(6)

In a letter of invitation of 25 October 2005 the Palestinian Authority invited the EU to launch an European Union Police Mission for the Palestinian Territories (EUPOL COPPS).


(7)

EUPOL COPPS will be complementary and will bring added value to current international efforts, as well as develop synergies with ongoing European Community and Member States efforts. EUPOL COPPS will seek coherence and coordination with the capacity-building actions of the Community, notably in the domain of criminal justice.


(8)

EU assistance will be conditional on the extent of the Palestinian Authority’s commitment and support for police reorganisation and reform. An adequate mechanism for coordination and cooperation with the relevant Palestinian authorities will be established during the planning phase to ensure their involvement in the development and follow-up of EUPOL COPPS. An adequate mechanism for coordination and cooperation with the relevant Israeli authorities will be established to ensure their facilitation of the EUPOL COPPS activities.


(9)

EUPOL COPPS will be set in the wider context of the international community’s effort to support the Palestinian Authority in taking responsibility for law and order, and in particular, in improving its civil police and law enforcement capacity. Close coordination between EUPOL COPPS and other international actors involved in security assistance, including the US Security Coordinator, as well as those providing support to the Palestinian Ministry of Interior, will be ensured.


(10)

EUPOL COPPS will implement its mandate in the context of a situation which poses a threat to law and order, the security and safety of individuals, and to the stability of the area and which could harm the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy as set out in Article 11 of the Treaty.


(11)

In conformity with the guidelines of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 to 9 December 2000, this Joint Action should determine the role of the Secretary-General/High Representative, in accordance with Articles 18 and 26 of the Treaty.


(12)

Article 14(1) of the Treaty calls for the indication of a financial reference amount for the whole period of implementation of the Joint Action. The indication of amounts to be financed by the Community budget illustrates the will of the legislative authority and is subject to the availability of commitment appropriations during the respective budget year,

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 377/2005
of 4 March 2005
repealing Regulation (EC) No 72/2005 suspending the preferential customs duties and re-establishing the Common Customs Tariff duty on imports of uniflorous (bloom) carnations originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (1), and in particular Article 5 (2)(b) thereof;
Whereas:

(1)

Following Council Decision 2005/4/EC of 22 December 2004 on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures and the replacement of Protocols 1 and 2 to the EC-Palestinian Authority Interim Association Agreement (2), it is no longer necessary, since 1 January 2005, to set minimum entry prices for roses and carnations imported from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip since the scheme of preferential customs duties will apply to all imports within the quota ceiling.


(2)

None the less, these prices were calculated, and the calculations led to the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 72/2005 (3).


(3)

It is therefore necessary to re-establish the preferential customs duties introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 of 9 April 2001 providing for the management of Community tariff quotas and of reference quantities for products eligible for preferences by virtue of agreements with certain Mediterranean countries and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1981/94 and (EC) No 934/95 (4).


(4)

Regulation (EC) No 72/2005 should therefore be repealed with effect from its date of entry into force, since the customs duties collected under this Regulation can be reimbursed under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (5) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6).


(5)

The Commission must take these measures in between the meetings of the Management Committee for Live Plants,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 72/2005 is hereby repealed with effect from 18 January 2005.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on 5 March 2005.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

DECISION No 896/2006/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 14 June 2006
establishing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by the Member States of certain residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein for the purpose of transit through their territory
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(a) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),
Whereas:

(1)

Pursuant to Article 21 of the Convention of 19 June 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (2) (hereinafter referred to as the Schengen Convention) residence permits issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis are to be mutually recognised as equivalent to the uniform visa.


(2)

The current Community rules do not, however, provide for a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders whereby the residence permits issued by third countries would be recognised as equivalent to the uniform visa for the purpose of transit through, or a short stay in, the common area.


(3)

Third-country nationals who hold a resident permit issued by Switzerland and who are subject to a visa obligation under Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those who are nationals are exempt from that requirement (3) must apply for a visa when they transit the common area on return to their country of origin. As a result, the consular offices of the Member States in Switzerland have to deal with large numbers of visa applications submitted by such third-country nationals. Similar difficulties have occurred as regards applications for visas by holders of residence permits issued by Liechtenstein.


(4)

As a result of the two-step implementation of the Schengen acquis, new Member States that acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 are required, from that date, to issue national visas to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein and who are subject to a visa obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Some of the new Member States have voiced concerns as to the additional administrative burden this will place on their consulates in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.


(5)

It does not appear necessary for Member States to require this category of persons to hold a visa, as they represent a low risk of illegal immigration for the Member States.


(6)

In order to address the situation in the consular offices in Switzerland and Liechtenstein both of Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis and of new Member States, a simplified regime should be introduced for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition of certain residence permits issued by the authorities of Switzerland and Liechtenstein as equivalent to uniform or national visas.


(7)

Such recognition should be limited to the purpose of transit and should not affect the possibility of Member States to issue visas for a short-term stay.


(8)

Application of the recognition regime should be compulsory for Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis and optional for new Member States that apply Decision No 895/2006/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 14 June 2006 introducing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories (4) during the transitional period until the date to be determined by the Council, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.


(9)

The entry conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (5) have to be fulfilled, with the exception of the condition laid down in Article 5(1)(b) thereof, in so far as this Decision sets up an equivalence regime between transit visas and residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein.


(10)

Since the objective of this Decision directly affects the Community acquis on visas and cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Decision, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.


(11)

As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning those two States' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1 point (A) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (6) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.


(12)

In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption by the Council of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark has, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, to decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law.


(13)

This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis, in which the United Kingdom does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (7). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.


(14)

This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis, in which Ireland does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (8). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
This Decision establishes a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by Member States of residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein to third-country nationals subject to a visa obligation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as equivalent to their uniform or national visas for the purpose of transit.
The implementation of this Decision shall not affect the checks to be carried out on persons at the external borders in compliance with Articles 5 to 13 and 18 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006.
Article 2
Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis shall unilaterally recognise the residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein which are listed in the Annex.
New Member States which apply Decision No 895/2006/EC may unilaterally recognise the residence permits listed in the Annex to this Decision as equivalent to their national transit visas until the date to be determined by the Council, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.
Article 3
The duration of the transit of the third-country national through the territory of the Member State(s) shall not exceed five days.
The period of validity of the documents listed in the Annex shall cover the duration of the transit.
Article 4
Any new Member State that decides to apply this Decision shall notify the Commission thereof by 1 August 2006. The Commission shall publish the information communicated by the new Member States in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 5
This Decision shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply until the date on which the provisions of Article 21 of the Schengen Convention take effect for Switzerland and Liechtenstein pursuant to Article 15 of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis.
Article 6
This Decision is addressed to the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 69/2006
of 16 January 2006
fixing Community producer and import prices for carnations and roses with a view to the application of the arrangements governing imports of certain floricultural products originating in Jordan
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (1), and in particular Article 5(2)(a) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

Under Articles 2(2) and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87, Community import and producer prices are fixed each fortnight for uniflorous (bloom) carnations, multiflorous (spray) carnations, large-flowered roses and small-flowered roses and apply for two-week periods. Under Article 1(b) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 700/88 of 17 March 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for the import into the Community of certain floricultural products originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (2), those prices are determined for two-week periods on the basis of weighted prices provided by the Member States.


(2)

Those prices should be fixed immediately so the customs duties applicable can be determined.


(3)

Following the accession of Cyprus to the European Union on 1 May 2004, it is no longer necessary to fix import prices for Cyprus.


(4)

Calculation of the uniform call rate for VAT own resources (Article 2(4) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom):

Uniform rate (%) = maximum call rate – frozen rate



A.


The maximum call rate is set at 0,50 % for 2007.




B.


Determination of the rate frozen by the correction of budgetary imbalances granted to the United Kingdom (Article 2(4)(b) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom):



(1)   calculation of the theoretical share of the countries with a restricted financial burden:


In accordance with Article 5(1) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom, the financial contribution of Germany (DE), the Netherlands (NL), Austria (AT) and Sweden (SE) is restricted to a quarter of their normal contribution.


Formula for a country with a restricted financial burden, for example Germany:


Germany's theoretical VAT contribution = (Germany's capped VAT base / (EU capped VAT base – UK capped VAT base)) × 1/4 × United Kingdom correction


Example: Germany


Germany's theoretical VAT contribution = 10 072 673 000 / (55 191 056 500 – 10 178 922 000) × 1/4 × 5 331 368 973 = 298 259 219


(2)   calculation of the frozen rate:


Frozen rate = [UK correction – theoretical VAT contributions (D + NL + A + S)] / [EU capped VAT base – capped VAT bases (UK+ D + NL + A + S)]

Frozen rate = (5 331 368 973 – (298 259 219 + 79 528 563 + 34 786 421 + 42 441 980)) / (55 191 056 500 – (10 178 922 000 + 10 072 673 000 + 2 685 802 000 + 1 174 791 000 + 1 433 331 000))

Frozen rate = 0,164488594287511 %


Uniform rate



0,5 % – 0,164488594287511 % = 0,335511405712489 %

Note: The difference of – € 106 465 028 between the definitive amount of the 2003 UK correction (€ 5 285 094 010, as calculated above) and the previously budgeted amount of the 2003 UK correction (€ 5 391 559 038, entered in the AB 8/2004) is financed in chapter 3 5 of the AB 5/2007. This impact is the so-called ‘direct effect’ of the UK correction. A supplementary adjustment, to take into account the so-called ‘indirect effect’ of the UK correction on the uniform rate of call of the VAT-based own resource, is also financed in chapter 3 5 of the AB 5/2007. This ‘indirect effect’ corresponds to a payment of € 22 443 975 to the United Kingdom, so that the total amount entered in chapter 3 5 of the AB 5/2007 is a payment of € 84 021 053 from the United Kingdom (= – € 106 465 028 + € 22 443 975).

COUNCIL DECISION

of 15 July 2008
implementing Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism and repealing Decision 2007/868/EC
(2008/583/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

On 20 December 2007 the Council adopted Decision 2007/868/EC implementing Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism (2), and establishing an updated list of persons and entities to which that Regulation applies.


(2)

The Council has provided all the persons, groups and entities for which it was practically possible with statements of reasons explaining why they were listed in Decision 2007/868/EC. Concerning one group and three persons the amended statements of reasons has been provided to them, if possible, in April 2008.


(3)

By way of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 December 2007 (3) the Council informed the persons, groups and entities listed in Decision 2007/868/EC that it had decided to keep them on the list. The Council also informed the persons, groups and entities concerned that it was possible to request a statement of the Council’s reasons for putting them on the list (where one had not already been communicated to them).


(4)

The Council has carried out a complete review of the list of persons, groups and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies, as required by Article 2(3) of that Regulation. When doing so it took account of observations submitted to the Council by those concerned.


(5)

In the case of one group, the Council has taken account of the fact that the decision by a competent authority on the basis of which the group was included on the list has not been in force since 24 June 2008. However, new information concerning the group has been brought to the Council’s attention. The Council considers that this new information warrants the group’s inclusion on the list.


(6)

The Council has determined that one person should be removed from the list of persons, groups and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies.


(7)

The Council has concluded that with the exception of the person mentioned in recital (6), the persons, groups and entities listed in the Annex to Common Position 2007/871/CFSP (4) have been involved in terrorist acts within the meaning of Article 1(2) and (3) of Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism (5), that a decision has been taken with respect to them by a competent authority within the meaning of Article 1(4) of that Common Position, and that they should continue to be subject to the specific restrictive measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001.


(8)

The list of the persons, groups and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies should be updated accordingly,

HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
The list provided for in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 shall be replaced by the list set out in the Annex to this Decision.
Article 2
Decision 2007/868/EC is hereby repealed.
Article 3
This Decision shall take effect on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT,

Having regard to Protocol No 2 amending the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon, and in particular Articles 3 and 5 thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 272(1) to (6) thereof,

Having regard to Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities own resources (1),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (2),
Having regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (3), and in particular the multiannual financial framework provided for in Part I thereof and set out in Annex I thereto,
Having regard to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010, which the Council established on 1 July 2009,
Having regard to the resolution adopted by Parliament on 22 October 2009 on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section III — Commission, and Letter of amendment No 1/2010 to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010,
Having regard to the resolution adopted by Parliament on 22 October 2009 on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section I — European Parliament, Section II — Council, Section IV — Court of Justice, Section V — Court of Auditors, Section VI — European Economic and Social Committee, Section VII — Committee of the Regions, Section VIII — European Ombudsman and Section IX — European Data Protection Supervisor,
Having regard to Letter of amendment No 2/2010 to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010,

Having regard to the amendments and proposed modifications adopted by Parliament on 22 October 2009 to the draft general budget,
Having regard to the Council’s modifications of 18 November 2009 to the amendments and proposed modifications adopted by Parliament to the draft general budget,
Having regard to the decisions of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2009 amending the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management as regards the multiannual financial framework — Financing projects in the field of energy in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan (4) and on the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument in accordance with Point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 (5),
Having regard to the outcome of the budget conciliation of 18 November 2009,
Having regard to the amendments adopted by Parliament on the modifications to its amendments on 17 December 2009,
Having regard to Rule 75e of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure,
Having regard to the resolution adopted by Parliament on 17 December 2009,
Whereas:

(1)

Until 30 November 2009, the budgetary procedure for the 2010 budget was conducted under Article 272 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.


(2)

As a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the procedure initiated under Article 272 of the Treaty establishing the European Community is to be completed under Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, is to be concluded by declaration of the President of the European Parliament in conformity with Article 314(9).


(3)

In order to enable the budgetary procedure for the 2010 budget to be completed within the time limits laid down in Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission, under the present exceptional circumstances, consider the budgetary procedure to be a continuum under the two abovementioned Treaties, such that the stages of the procedure completed under the Treaty of Nice will deploy their effects following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.


(4)

During the budgetary conciliation of 18 November 2009 the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission agreed to a joint declaration on the continuity of the 2010 budgetary procedure (6), underlining that the stages of the procedure completed under the Treaty establishing the European Community exceptionally deploy their legal effects on the following part of the procedure laid down in Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.


(5)

In this regard, the three institutions consider that the agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council at the conciliation meeting on 18 November 2009, followed by and incorporated in the Council’s and Parliament’s respective second readings of the 2010 budget, is to be considered in substance as an agreement on a joint text within the meaning of Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in full compliance with the multiannual financial framework.


(6)

This agreement also relates to the other items amended in the European Parliament’s second reading conducted in full compliance with the multiannual financial framework.


(7)

In a statement made in Plenary on 17 December 2009 on the amendments adopted by Parliament on that date before the definitive adoption of the budget for 2010, this agreement was confirmed by the Council.


(8)

It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (7) that the main prerequisite for the budgetary procedure to be regularly completed is the explicit and unambiguous agreement, by both arms of the budgetary authority, on all items on which an agreement is required; and whereas this requirement has thus been complied with,

DECLARES:
Sole Article
The procedure initiated under Article 272 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 177 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community and continued under Article 314 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is complete and the European Union's general budget for the financial year 2010 has been definitively adopted.

A. INTRODUCTION AND FINANCING OF THE GENERAL BUDGET
INTRODUCTION
The general budget of the European Union is the instrument which sets out and authorises the total amount of revenue and expenditure deemed necessary for the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community for each year.
The budget is established and implemented in compliance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency.

—

The principle of unity and the principle of budgetary accuracy mean that all Community revenue and expenditure and that of the European Union when it is charged to the budget must be incorporated in a single document.


—

The principle of annuality means that the budget is adopted for one budgetary year at a time and that both commitment and payment appropriations for the current budgetary year must, in principle, be used in the course of the year.


—

The principle of equilibrium means that forecasts of revenue for the budgetary year must be equal to payment appropriations for that year: borrowing to cover any budget deficit which may arise is not compatible with the own resources system and will not be authorised.


—

In accordance with the principle of unit of account, the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts shall be presented in euros.


—

The principle of universality means that total revenue is to cover total payment appropriations with the exception of a limited number of revenue items which are assigned to particular items of expenditure. All revenue and expenditure is entered in full in the budget without any adjustment against each other.


—

The principle of specification means that each appropriation must have a given purpose and be assigned to a specific objective in order to prevent any confusion between appropriations.


—

The principle of sound financial management is defined by reference to the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.


—

The budget is established in compliance with the principle of transparency, ensuring sound information on implementation of the budget and the accounts.

The budget presents appropriations and resources by purpose (activity-based budgeting), with a view to enhancing transparency in the management of the budget with reference to the objectives of sound financial management and in particular efficiency and effectiveness.
The expenditure authorised by the present budget totals EUR 141 452 827 822 in commitment appropriations and EUR 122 937 000 000 in payment appropriations, representing a growth rate of 3,57 % and of 8,76 % respectively by comparison with the 2009 budget.
Budgetary revenue totals EUR 122 937 000 000. The uniform rate of call for the VAT resource is 0,30 % (except for Austria, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden for which the rate of call has been fixed at 0,225 %, 0,15 %, 0,10 % and 0,10 % respectively) whilst that for the GNI resource is 0,7894 %. Traditional own resources (customs duties and sugar levies) account for 11,55 % of the financing of the budget for 2010. The VAT resource accounts for 11,35 % and the GNI resource for 75,94 %. Other revenue for this financial year is estimated at EUR 1 430 296 272.
The own resources needed to finance the 2010 budget account for 1,03 % of the total GNI, thus falling below the ceiling of 1,24 % of GNI calculated using the method set out in Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (OJ L 163, 23.6.2007, p. 17).
The tables below set out step by step the method used to calculate the financing of the 2010 budget.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 954/2009
of 13 October 2009
amending for the 114th time Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 prohibiting the export of certain goods and services to Afghanistan, strengthening the flight ban and extending the freeze of funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan, (1) and in particular the first indent of Article 7(1) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 lists the persons, groups and entities covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources under that Regulation. It includes Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi, who were listed in 2002 (2) and 2003 (3), respectively.


(2)

Each natural person concerned challenged the listing decision made as regards him. The Court of First Instance rejected their challenges (4). Appeals against the judgments of the Court of First Instance are pending in the Court of Justice (5).


(3)

Following recent case-law of the Court of Justice (6), the UN Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee provided, in spring 2009, the grounds for its decisions listing Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi. The Commission has published notices (7) for the attention of the person concerned to inform them that the UN Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee had provided the grounds for their listing, which would be communicated upon request with a view to giving them the opportunity to make his point of view on these grounds known. Communications were sent to the addresses included in the relevant entries. Furthermore, by communications dated 24 June 2009, the grounds for listing were notified to either person concerned, at the address of his lawyer, in order to give them the opportunity to comment on these grounds and to make their point of view known.


(4)

The Commission has received comments from Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and from Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi and examined these comments.


(5)

The list of persons, groups and entities to whom the freezing of funds and economic resources should apply, drawn up by the UN Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, currently comprises Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi.


(6)

After having carefully considered the comments received from Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi in a letter dated 23 July 2009, and given the preventive nature of the freezing of funds and economic resources, the Commission considers that the listing of Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi is justified for reasons of his association with the Al-Qaida network.


(7)

After having carefully considered the comments received from Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi in a letter dated 16 July 2009, and given the preventive nature of the freezing of funds and economic resources, the Commission considers the listing of Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi is justified for reasons of his association with the Al-Qaida network.


(8)

In view of this, the listing decisions concerning Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi should be replaced by new decisions confirming their inclusion in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002.


(9)

These new decisions should apply from 30 May 2002 as regards Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and from 21 November 2003 as regards Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi, given the preventive nature and objectives of the freezing of funds and economic resources under Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 and the need to protect legitimate interests of the economic operators, who have been relying on the decisions made in 2002 and 2003.


(10)

The Sanctions Committee amended the identifying data concerning Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi on 16 September 2008 and 23 March 2009. The published information (8) concerning Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi should therefore be updated.


(11)

The Sanctions Committee amended the identifying data concerning Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi on 11 August 2008, 30 January 2009 and 13 February 2009. The published information (9) concerning Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi should therefore be updated,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 30 May 2002 as regards Mr Shafiq Ben Mohamed Ben Mohamed Al-Ayadi and from 21 November 2003 as regards Mr Faraj Faraj Hussein Al-Sa’idi.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1351/2011
of 20 December 2011
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 as regards the suspension of tariff quotas of the Union and reference quantities for certain agricultural products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 of 9 April 2001 providing for the management of Community tariff quotas and of reference quantities for products eligible for preferences by virtue of agreements with certain Mediterranean countries and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1981/94 and (EC) No 934/95 (1), and in particular Article 5(1)(b) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

An Agreement has been concluded in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union, of the one part, and the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, of the other part, providing further liberalisation of agricultural products, processed agricultural products and fish and fishery products and amending the Euro-Mediterranean Interim Association Agreement on trade and cooperation between the European Community, of the one part, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, of the other part (2) (the Agreement). The Agreement was approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision 2011/824/EU (3).


(2)

The Agreement provides for a period of 10 years from the date of its entry into force, for enlarged tariff concessions applicable to imports into the European Union of unlimited quantities of products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Moreover, a further possible extension of the enlarged tariff concessions is also envisaged in the Agreement, depending on the future economic development of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.


(3)

Since the Agreement provides for a further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products and fish and fishery products, it is necessary to suspend the application of the tariff quotas and reference quantities laid down in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 for products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, during the application period of the Agreement.


(4)

Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (4), was repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (5).


(5)

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 700/88 of 17 March 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for the import into the Community of certain floricultural products originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (6), was repealed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2006 (7).


(6)

As a result of those repeals Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 providing for non-eligibility for the tariff concessions for fresh cut flowers and flower buds where the price conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 are not observed, has become redundant and should therefore be deleted.


(7)

Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.


(8)

Since the Agreement enters into force on 1 January 2012, this Regulation should apply from that date.


(9)

The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 is amended as follows:

(1)

the following Article 1a is inserted:
‘Article 1a
Suspension of the application of tariff quotas and reference quantities for products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
The application of the tariff quotas and reference quantities laid down in Annex VIII for products originating in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip shall be temporarily suspended for a period of 10 years from 1 January 2012.
However, depending on the future economic development of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a possible extension for an additional period could be considered at the latest 1 year before the expiration of the 10 years period as provided by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters approved on behalf of the Union by Council Decision 2011/824/EU (8).


(2)

Article 2 is deleted.

Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2012.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

and conferences (course instructors/speakers and their travel and subsistence expenses, and teaching materials),- the cost of attending external training and of joining the relevant professional organisations,- expenditure related to the practical aspects of organising such courses and the use of premises and transport and the cost of food and accommodation for the participants of residential courses,- training expenditure related to publications and information, associated Internet sites and the purchase of teaching equipment, subscriptions and licences for distance teaching, books, press and multimedia products,- financing teaching aids.Any revenue from the contributions from candidate countries and, if applicable, the western Balkan potential candidate countries for participating in Union programmes entered in Item 6 0 3 1 of the statement of revenue may give rise to the provision of additional appropriations in accordance with Article 18(1)(d) of the Financial Regulation.Revenue from contributions from the EFTA States to the Union’s general costs under Article 82 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area gives rise to the provision of supplementary appropriations to be entered in the budget headings concerned in accordance with the Financial Regulation. The amount of such revenue is estimated at EUR 1027000.Any revenue from the Swiss Confederation’s contribution for participation in Union programmes entered under Item 6 0 3 3 of the statement of revenue may give rise to the provision of additional appropriations in accordance with Article 18(1)(d) of the Financial Regulation.The amount of assigned revenue based on data available in accordance with Article 18(1)(e) to (j) of the Financial Regulation is estimated at EUR 6106200.Part of this appropriation should be used for building a Union-wide methodology and robust measurement capacity per unit of production to fill in existing data gaps for sustainability indicators and to further develop evidence-based agricultural instruments that reward producers who deliver environmental public goods, notably by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in view of the reform of the CAP towards 2020.Part of this appropriation should cover investigation on every step from smart production with metals and minerals savings to substitution of potentially critical raw materials by less critical ones.Another option is to investigate the reusability of parts containing scarce materials and whether they can be made more robust to allow them to be shifted from one product to another. The scarce resources and the functionalities they enable may not be the ""weak point"" and may not wear, so an option could be to design the component with scarce materials in such a way that it lasts longer. The target will be quick-turnover appliances and then a proposal for an appropriate incentives scheme to stimulate reusability.The possibility of the data encoded in the product delivering information about where the scarce resources are should be explored, together with the way to handle them in order to maximise recycling, as well as information about chemical contents of the product making differentiated treatment possible (for example, depollution is not needed if there are no hazards, thus ensuring cost optimisation for recyclers).Exploring the technical and economical feasibility of such individual identification is a key challenge for the future. This would also be a serious move towards real IPR and creating the conditions for increased competition towards optimised end-of-life management.Conditions for releasing the reserveThe Commission shall modify the rules on expert groups in the following way:(1) scrap exceptions to the obligation to have a balanced composition of expert groups (technical nature + experts in ""personal capacity""); prohibit a single interest category (business, union or other) from having the majority of the non-government and non-Union seats in any expert group; provide safeguards against capture from special interests and corporate interests;(2) ban lobbyists and corporate executives from sitting in expert groups in a ""personal capacity"". The Commission should clarify whether members of an expert group are there as stakeholders or as experts committed to acting in the public interest. The latter should be thoroughly checked for conflicts of interest and their ""declaration of professional activities"" should be in the public domain;(3) establish common selection criteria throughout all Directorates-General, that guarantee balance among different categories of stakeholders and absence of conflict of interests for experts and establish an obligatory open selection process with a public call and a published mandate of each expert group which goes beyond a simple representation of Member State authorities;(4) all membership information (including affiliations), agendas, minutes and participants’ submissions should be available online unless there is a clear and published reason for not providing such information; reports of groups should be published before adoption by the Commission.Legal basisStaff Regulations of Officials of the European Union.XX 01 02 12 Other management expenditure relating to Commission staff in Union delegationsTitle Chapter Article Item |

CONSIDERING the pan-Euro-Mediterranean system of cumulation of origin, which is made up of a network of Free Trade Agreements and provides for identical rules of origin allowing for diagonal cumulation,
CONSIDERING the possible future extension of the geographical scope of diagonal cumulation to neighbouring countries and territories,
CONSIDERING the difficulties in the management of the current network of bilateral protocols on rules of origin among the countries or territories of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone, it is desirable to transpose the existing bilateral systems on rules of origin into a multilateral framework, without prejudice to the principles laid down in the relevant agreements or any other related bilateral agreements,

CONSIDERING that the rules of origin will need to be amended in order to better respond to the economic reality,
CONSIDERING the idea to base cumulation of origin on a single legal instrument in the form of a regional convention on preferential rules of origin, to which the individual free trade agreements applicable between the countries of the zone would refer,
CONSIDERING that the following regional Convention does not lead overall to a less favourable situation than in the previous relation between the free trade partners which apply the pan-euro or pan-euro-med cumulation,
CONSIDERING that the idea of a regional convention on preferential rules of origin for the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone received the support of the Euro-Med Trade Ministers during their meeting in Lisbon on 21 October 2007,
CONSIDERING that a main objective of a single regional convention is to move towards the application of identical rules of origin for the purpose of cumulation of origin for goods traded between all Contracting Parties,

Article 5
Sufficiently worked or processed products
1.   For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.
The conditions referred to above indicate the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

(a)

their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;


(b)

any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph.

This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.
3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6.
Article 6

(p)

a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (n);


(q)

2.   All operations carried out in the exporting Contracting Party on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.
Article 7
Unit of qualification
1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Convention shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.
It follows that:

(a)

when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;


(b)

when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Convention.

2.   Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.
Article 8
Accessories, spare parts and tools
Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.
Article 9
Sets
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15% of the ex-works price of the set.

(a)

the returning goods are the same as those exported; and


(b)

they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.

3.   The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the exporting Contracting Party on materials exported from the latter Contracting Party and subsequently re-imported there, provided:

(a)

the said materials are wholly obtained in the exporting Contracting Party or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 prior to being exported; and

4.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the exporting Contracting Party. However, where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the exporting Contracting Party, taken together with the total added value acquired outside this Contracting Party by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.
5.   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, ‘total added value’ means all costs arising outside the exporting Contracting Party, including the value of the materials incorporated there.
6.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 5(2) is applied.

the products may be used in the importing Contracting Party as materials in the context of cumulation for the manufacture of products for export from the importing Contracting Party to one of the other Contracting Parties referred to in Article 3, or


(iii)

the products may be re-exported from the importing Contracting Party to one of the Contracting Parties referred to in Article 3.


4.   An origin declaration EUR-MED shall contain one of the following statements in English:

(a)

if origin has been obtained by application of cumulation with materials originating in one or more of the Contracting Parties:
‘CUMULATION APPLIED WITH … (name of the country/countries)’


(b)

if origin has been obtained without the application of cumulation with materials originating in one or more of the Contracting Parties:
‘NO CUMULATION APPLIED’

5.   The exporter making out an origin declaration or an origin declaration EUR-MED shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Convention.
6.   An origin declaration or an origin declaration EUR-MED shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the texts of which appear in Annexes IV a and b, using one of the linguistic versions set out in those Annexes and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.
7.   Origin declarations and origin declarations EUR-MED shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 22 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.
8.   An origin declaration or an origin declaration EUR-MED may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation on condition that it is presented in the importing country at the latest two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.
Article 22
Approved exporter
1.   The customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party may authorise any exporter (hereinafter referred to as ‘approved exporter’), who makes frequent shipments of products in accordance to the provisions of this Convention to make out origin declarations or origin declarations EUR-MED irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Convention.
2.   The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.
3.   The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration or on the origin declaration EUR-MED.
4.   The customs authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.
5.   The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.
Article 23
Validity of proof of origin
1.   A proof of origin shall be valid for four months from the date of issue in the exporting Contracting Party, and shall be submitted within that period to the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party.
2.   Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.
3.   In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date.
Article 24
Submission of proof of origin
Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country. The said authorities may require a translation of a proof of origin and may also require the import declaration to be accompanied by a statement from the importer to the effect that the products meet the conditions required for the implementation of the relevant Agreement.
Article 25
Importation by instalments
Where, at the request of the importer and subject to the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonised System falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.
Article 26
Exemptions from proof of origin
1.   Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers’ personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Convention and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, that declaration may be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.
2.   Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.
3.   Furthermore, the total value of these products shall not exceed EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers’ personal luggage.
Article 27
Supporting documents
The documents referred to in Articles 16(3) and 21(5) used for the purpose of proving that products covered by a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED or an origin declaration or origin declaration EUR-MED may be considered as products originating in a Contracting Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Convention may consist inter alia of the following:

(1)

direct evidence of the processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal bookkeeping;


(2)

documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in the relevant Contracting Party where these documents are used in accordance with national law;

Discrepancies and formal errors
1.   The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.
2.   Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.
Article 30
Amounts expressed in euro
1.   For the application of the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) and Article 26(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Contracting Parties equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.

A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value.
5.   The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Joint Committee at the request of any Contracting Party. When carrying out this review, the Joint Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.
TITLE VI

ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION

Article 31
Administrative cooperation
1.   The customs authorities of the Contracting Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates, origin declarations and origin declarations EUR-MED.
2.   In order to ensure the proper application of this Convention, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other, through the competent customs administrations, in checking the authenticity of the movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, the origin declarations and the origin declarations EUR-MED and the correctness of the information given in these documents.
Article 32
Verification of proofs of origin
1.   Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Convention.
2.   For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party shall return the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED and the invoice, if it has been submitted, the origin declaration or the origin declaration EUR-MED, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the request for verification. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.
3.   The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting Contracting Party. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate.
4.   If the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.
5.   The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results thereof as soon as possible. These results shall indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned may be considered as products originating in one of the Contracting Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Convention.
6.   If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within ten months of the date of the verification request or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.
Article 33
Dispute settlement
Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 32 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification, they shall be submitted to the bilateral body established by the relevant Agreement. Where disputes other than those related to the verification procedures of Article 32 arise in relation to the interpretation of this Convention, they shall be submitted to the Joint Committee.
In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing Contracting Party shall take place under the legislation of that country.
Article 34
Penalties
Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.
Article 35
Free zones
1.   The Contracting Parties shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a proof of origin, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.
2.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, when products originating in a Contracting Party are imported into a free zone under cover of a proof of origin and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned shall issue a new movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED at the exporter’s request, if the treatment or processing undergone complies with this Convention.


(1)  Due to the Customs Union between Liechtenstein and Switzerland, products originating in Liechtenstein are cosidered as originating in Switzerland.

(2)  The Principality of Liechtenstein has a customs union with Switzerland and is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area..

ANNEX I

Introductory notes to the list in Annex II


Note 1:

The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 5 of this Appendix.

Note 2:


2.1.

The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an ’ex’, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.


2.2.

Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.


2.3.

Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4.


2.4.

Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4. If no origin rule is given in column 4, the rule set out in column 3 is to be applied.


Note 3:


3.1.

The provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.

Example:


 

An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex 7224.


 

If this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.



3.2.

The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.


3.3.

Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading’, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.
However, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.


3.4.

When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

Example:

The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.


3.5.

Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).

Example:


 

The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.


 

However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.


Example:

In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn – that is, the fibre stage.


3.6.

Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.


Note 4:


4.1.

The term ‘natural fibres’ is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.


4.2.

The term ‘natural fibres’ includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.


4.3.

The terms ‘textile pulp’, ‘chemical materials’ and ‘paper-making materials’ are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.


4.4.

The term ‘man-made staple fibres’ is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.


Note 5:


5.1.

Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).


5.2.

However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.
The following are the basic textile materials:

COUNCIL DECISION 2012/635/CFSP
of 15 October 2012
amending Decision 2010/413/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 29 thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

On 27 February 2007, the Council adopted Common Position 2007/140/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran (1) which implemented United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737 (2006).


(2)

On 23 April 2007, Common Position 2007/140/CFSP was amended by Common Position 2007/246/CFSP (2) in order to implement UNSCR 1747 (2007). The Council then further amended Common Position 2007/140/CFSP by adopting, on 7 August 2008, Common Position 2008/652/CFSP (3), which implemented UNSCR 1803 (2008).


(3)

On 26 July 2010, the Council adopted Decision 2010/413/CFSP (4) which implemented UNSCR 1929 (2010) and repealed Common Position 2007/140/CFSP.


(4)

On 23 January 2012, the Council adopted Decision 2012/35/CFSP which amended Decision 2010/413/CFSP by strengthening the restrictive measures against Iran in light of the reiterated serious and deepening concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear programme, and in particular over the findings on Iranian activities relating to the development of military nuclear technology, as reflected in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report. Those measures were further strengthened on 15 March 2012 by Decision 2012/152/CFSP (5).


(5)

In view of Iran's failure to engage seriously in negotiations in order to address international concerns about its nuclear programme, the Council considers it necessary to adopt additional restrictive measures against Iran.


(6)

In this context, it is appropriate to review the prohibition on the sale, supply or transfer to Iran of additional dual-use goods and technology listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (6), with a view to including items which might be relevant to industries controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or which might be relevant to Iran's nuclear, military and ballistic missile programme, while taking into account the need to avoid unintended effects on the civilian population of Iran.


(7)

Moreover, the purchase, import or transport of natural gas from Iran should be prohibited.


(8)

Furthermore, the sale, supply or transfer to Iran of graphite, and raw or semi-finished metals such as aluminium and steel, and software for integrating industrial processes, which is relevant to industries controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or which is relevant to Iran's nuclear, military and ballistic missile programme, should be prohibited.


(9)

The sale, supply or transfer to Iran of key naval equipment and technology for ship-building, maintenance or refit, should be prohibited.


(10)

In addition, Member States should not enter into any new commitments to provide financial support for trade with Iran. This should not affect existing commitments and should not concern trade for food, agricultural, medical or other humanitarian purposes.


(11)

It should also be prohibited for Member States to construct or participate in the construction of new oil tankers for Iran.


(12)

In order to prevent the transfer of any financial or other assets or resources that could contribute to Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, transactions between Union and Iranian banks and financial institutions should be prohibited, unless authorised in advance by the relevant Member State. This should not prevent the continuation of trade which is not prohibited under Decision 2010/413/CFSP.


(13)

Furthermore, the provision of flagging and classification services to Iranian oil tankers and cargo vessels should be prohibited.


(14)

The supply of vessels designed for the transport or storage of oil and petrochemical products to Iranian persons and entities or to other persons and entities for the purpose of transporting or storing Iranian oil and petrochemical products should be prohibited.


(15)

In addition, the provisions concerning the freezing of funds and economic resources of the Central Bank of Iran should be amended.


(16)

Finally, additional persons and entities should be included in the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures as set out in Annex II to Decision 2010/413/CFSP, in particular Iranian State-owned entities engaged in the oil and gas sector, since they provide a substantial source of revenue for the Iranian Government. Furthermore, certain persons and entities should be removed from that list and the entry for one entity should be amended.


(17)

Further action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain measures provided for in this Decision.


(18)

Decision 2010/413/CFSP should therefore be amended accordingly,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1

Remarks

Any delay by a MemberState in making the entry in the account opened in the name of the Commission referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 gives rise to the payment of interest by the MemberState concerned.

Remarks

The Commission may impose fines, periodic penalty payments and other penalties on undertakings and associations of undertakings for not respecting bans or not carrying out their obligations under the Regulations enumerated below or under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
The fines must normally be paid within three months of the Commission decision being notified. However, the Commission will not collect the amount due when the undertaking has lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice of the European Union; the undertaking must accept that interest will be paid on the debt after the final date for payment and provide the Commission with a bank guarantee covering both the principal of the debt and interest or surcharges by the final date for payment.

(2)

On the basis of a review of Decision 2011/782/CFSP, the Council has concluded that the restrictive measures should be renewed until 1 March 2013.


(3)

Furthermore, it is necessary to update the list of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures as set out in Annex I to Decision 2011/782/CFSP.

(6)

Further action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain measures,

Remarks

The aim of this appropriation is to foster the competitiveness of enterprises and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to promote innovation, including eco-innovation, and to support enterprise and innovation-related economic and administrative reform.
The implemented measures shall be, in particular:

—

networks bringing together a variety of stakeholders,


—

market replication, projects and other measures to support the take-up of innovation,


—

policy analyses, development and coordination with participating countries,


—

information sharing, dissemination and awareness raising,


—

support to joint actions of Member States or regions,

and other measures encompassed in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.
The Union will provide support to activities such as the Enterprise Europe Network, innovation and entrepreneurship promotion. It will also support eco-innovation projects concerned with the first applications or market replication of innovative or eco-innovative techniques, products or practices of Union relevance which have already been technically demonstrated with success but, owing to residual risk, have not yet significantly penetrated the market. These will be designed to promote their broader utilisation within the participating countries and facilitate their market uptake.
As the ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’ preparatory action, expires in 2011 and will be integrated in the new multiannual financial framework only as of 2014, its continuation needs financing for the years 2012 and 2013. The programme aims at fostering European entrepreneurship, the sharing of knowledge and best practices as well as the creation of valuable networks and partnerships. Part of this appropriation should be used to ensure the smooth functioning and continuation of ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’ through the CIP's Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme until the new financial framework is put in place.
The contributions from the EFTA States pursuant to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 82 thereof and Protocol 32 thereto, must be added to the appropriations entered in this article. By way of information, these amounts derive from contributions from the EFTA States entered against Article 6 3 0 of the statement of revenue, which constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(2)(e) to (g) of the Financial Regulation; they give rise to the provision of corresponding appropriations and to implementation under the ‘European Economic Area’ Annex to this part of the statement of expenditure in this section, which forms an integral part of the general budget.
The proposed action aims at developing and testing innovation support services for European knowledge-based start-up companies which make use of the extended networks of European expatriates in science and business in the Silicon Valley. Young companies shall thus realise faster market access and growth overseas while creating high-value added jobs in Europe. This requires coordinated action of European innovation support providers. The action shall therefore ultimately explore the feasibility of a joint ‘European Innovation Centre’ in an innovation hot spot. This centre shall link official representations (chambers of commerce, consulates and industry representations), innovation support providers for European start-ups with European entrepreneurs and scientists that chose to live and work in the Silicon Valley for better coordinated support to potential high-growth companies.

Target groups

Central to this action is the development and piloting of novel services which facilitate fast growth and access to capital for young knowledge-based companies by combining the networks of European expatriate entrepreneurs and researchers in the Silicon Valley with the services of regional / national innovation support agencies in Europe.
One knowledge based young company from each Member State shall be invited to test the services, to establish own networks in the Silicon Valley ecosystem and to feed-back experience and advice on the future design of such services.
Innovation agencies in the Member States are invited to select the young companies and to accompany the project contributing their expertise in the support of young companies. Agencies with offices in the Silicon Valley shall be invited to contribute to the design and provision of services in particular the provision of office space for the European young companies.
Networks of expatriate entrepreneurs and researchers (1) shall be invited to contribute to the training and networking of European young companies and co-design innovation support services targeted at young knowledge-based companies.

Proposed activities


(1)

Two workshops or conferences (one in the United States, one in Europe) which bring together European innovation support providers with expatriate scientists or entrepreneurs to further develop an approach for a joint delivery of support to young companies with growth potential.


(2)

An accompanying study evaluating the expectations and experience of knowledge-based young companies as well as of expat networks participating.


(3)

The design and delivery of specific support services for a group of 27 knowledge-based young companies with growth potential from all Member States. These services shall include the organisation of sector specific networking and training events in the Silicon Valley.


(4)

A final conference with stakeholders from the European Parliament, the Commission services, young companies benefiting from pilot action, representatives of the expatriates’ networks and innovation support agencies.


(5)

Specific communication actions related to the action.

A suitable platform for the proposed action is the ProInno Europe/Europe Innova initiative established by the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry to facilitate policy development and joint service provision of regional and national innovation agencies.
Any revenue from the contributions from candidate countries and, if applicable, the western Balkan potential candidate countries for participating in Union programmes entered in Item 6 0 3 1 of the statement of revenue may give rise to the provision of additional appropriations in accordance with Article 21(2)(e) to (g) of the Financial Regulation.
Any revenue from contributions from third parties entered in Item 6 0 3 3 of the statement of revenue will give rise to the provision of additional appropriations to be entered in this item in accordance with the Financial Regulation.
In addition, part of this appropriation is intended to finance a Young Innovators Mobility (YIM) action. It is generally recognised that professional mobility is essential to the development of a versatile workforce, to a sense of European citizenship, and to reinforcing Europe's competitiveness. Innovative ideas should not stop at national borders, they should grow through cross-fertilisation, testing and validation within the widest European pool of talent, facilities, infrastructure and financing. Just as European students benefit from the mobility experience of the Erasmus programme, young researchers from the Marie Curie actions, and young entrepreneurs from Erasmus for Entrepreneurs, young innovators too deserve the opportunity for cross-border mobility to the benefit of innovation in Europe. Existing mobility programmes do not match the scope covered by the YIM action, which focuses on the Innovation process of developing new early-stage ideas into demonstrators. For instance, this project differentiates itself from Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs which is mainly a business exchange programme focussed on the post-innovation stage, enabling new entrepreneurs to learn or improve their business-related skills. By combining the benefits of mobility, the need to narrow the innovation gap and the need to change the mindset to promote innovation, the proposal for a YIM action constitutes a concrete step towards the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy for growth and jobs and the ‘Innovation Union’ as well as ‘Youth on the Move’ flagship initiatives in particular.
The YIM action aims to support a minimum of 100 young innovators. YIM would operate as a borderless mobility and innovation residency programme, enabling young (25 to 36 years old) and potential innovators (18 to 24 years old) to work on their own early-stage idea as a ‘young innovator in residence’ at a host organisation which could be a large or small company, start-up, laboratory, university, institute, government agency or NGO.

Remarks

The aim of this appropriation is to:

—

enable initial operations of GMES services, tailored to the needs of users,


—

contribute to ensuring availability of the observation infrastructure necessary to enable the GMES services,


—

create opportunities for increased private sector usage of information sources, thereby facilitating innovation by value-adding service providers.

In particular, development of Earth monitoring-based services plays a key role in enhancing competitiveness and innovation in industries in this sector and in the downstream markets. Sustainable provision of Earth monitoring-related services in Europe still requires consistent public intervention. This is not only because of market failures in answering diverse public needs but also because the downstream market is a non-mature market relying heavily on public funding and whose development has, until today, been significantly curbed by uncertainties about the affordability and long-term availability of the basic services and the data they build upon. Achievement of the specific objectives outlined above will therefore contribute to growth and job creation in an innovative sector, the downstream segment which is composed mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises. These services will facilitate access to key data required in policy formulation at Union, national, regional and local level in fields such as agriculture, forest monitoring, water management, transport, urban planning, climate change and many others. This appropriation also covers implementation of delegation agreements, including the operating costs incurred by entities to which the Commission delegates tasks for the GMES programme, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 and Article 54 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1).
The contributions from the EFTA States pursuant to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 82 thereof and Protocol 32 thereto, must be added to the appropriations entered in this article. By way of information, these amounts derive from contributions from the EFTA States entered against Article 6 3 0 of the statement of revenue, which constitute assigned revenue in accordance with Article 21(2)(e) to (g) of the Financial Regulation; they give rise to the provision of corresponding appropriations and to implementation under the ‘European Economic Area’ Annex to this part of the statement of expenditure in this section, which forms an integral part of the general budget.
Any revenue from the contributions from candidate countries and, if applicable, the western Balkan potential candidate countries for participating in Union programmes entered in Item 6 0 3 1 of the statement of revenue may give rise to the provision of additional appropriations in accordance with Article 21(2)(e) to (g) of the Financial Regulation.
Any revenue from contributions from third parties entered in Item 6 0 3 3 of the statement of revenue will give rise to the provision of additional appropriations to be entered in this item in accordance with the Financial Regulation.

A.   INTRODUCTION AND FINANCING OF THE GENERAL BUDGET


INTRODUCTION

The general budget of the European Union is the instrument which sets out and authorises the total amount of revenue and expenditure deemed necessary for the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community for each year.
The budget is established and implemented in compliance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency.

—

The principle of unity and the principle of budgetary accuracy mean that all revenue and expenditure of the Union when it is charged to the budget must be incorporated in a single document.


—

The principle of annuality means that the budget is adopted for one budgetary year at a time and that both commitment and payment appropriations for the current budgetary year must, in principle, be used in the course of the year.


—

The principle of equilibrium means that forecasts of revenue for the budgetary year must be equal to payment appropriations for that year; borrowing to cover any budget deficit which may arise is not compatible with the own resources system and will not be authorised.


—

In accordance with the principle of unit of account, the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts shall be presented in euros.


—

The principle of universality means that total revenue is to cover total payment appropriations with the exception of a limited number of revenue items which are assigned to particular items of expenditure. Revenue and expenditure are entered in full in the budget without any adjustment against each other.


—

The principle of specification means that each appropriation must have a given purpose and be assigned to a specific objective in order to prevent any confusion between appropriations.


—

The principle of sound financial management is defined by reference to the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.


—

The budget is established in compliance with the principle of transparency, ensuring sound information on the implementation of the budget and the accounts.

The budget presents appropriations and resources by purpose (activity-based budgeting), with a view to enhancing transparency in the management of the budget with reference to the objectives of sound financial management and in particular efficiency and effectiveness.
The expenditure authorised by the present budget totals EUR 142 640 479 571 in commitment appropriations and EUR 135 504 613 000 in payment appropriations, representing a variation rate of –6,21 % and of –6,19 % respectively by comparison with the 2013 budget.
Budgetary revenue totals EUR 135 504 613 000. The uniform rate of call for the VAT resource is 0,30 % whilst that for the GNI resource is 0,7390 %. Traditional own resources (customs duties and sugar levies) account for 12,04 % of the financing of the budget for 2014. The VAT resource accounts for 13,20 % and the GNI resource for 73,63 %. Other revenue for this financial year is estimated at EUR 1 544 428 277.
The own resources needed to finance the 2014 budget account for 0,99 % of the total GNI, thus falling below the ceiling of 1,23 % of GNI calculated using the method set out in Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (OJ L 163, 23.6.2007, p. 17).
The tables below set out step by step the method used to calculate the financing of the 2014 budget.

A.   INTRODUCTION AND FINANCING OF THE GENERAL BUDGET


INTRODUCTION

The general budget of the Union is the instrument which sets out and authorises the total amount of revenue and expenditure deemed necessary for the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community for each year.
The budget is established and implemented in compliance with the principles of unity, budgetary accuracy, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, specification, sound financial management and transparency.

—

The principle of unity and the principle of budgetary accuracy mean that all revenue and expenditure of the Union when it is charged to the budget must be incorporated in a single document.


—

The principle of annuality means that the budget is adopted for one budgetary year at a time and that both commitment and payment appropriations for the current budgetary year must, in principle, be used in the course of the year.


—

The principle of equilibrium means that forecasts of revenue for the budgetary year must be equal to payment appropriations for that year; borrowing to cover any budget deficit which may arise is not compatible with the own resources system and will not be authorised.


—

In accordance with the principle of unit of account, the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts shall be presented in euros.


—

The principle of universality means that total revenue is to cover total payment appropriations with the exception of a limited number of revenue items which are assigned to particular items of expenditure. Revenue and expenditure are entered in full in the budget without any adjustment against each other.


—

The principle of specification means that each appropriation must have a given purpose and be assigned to a specific objective in order to prevent any confusion between appropriations.


—

The principle of sound financial management is defined by reference to the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.


—

The budget is established in compliance with the principle of transparency, ensuring sound information on the implementation of the budget and the accounts.

The budget presents appropriations and resources by purpose (activity-based budgeting), with a view to enhancing transparency in the management of the budget with reference to the objectives of sound financial management and in particular efficiency and effectiveness.
The expenditure authorised by the present budget totals EUR 145 321 531 152 in commitment appropriations and EUR 141 214 040 563 in payment appropriations, representing a variation rate of + 1,84 % and of + 1,57 % respectively by comparison with the 2014 budget.
Budgetary revenue totals EUR 141 214 040 563. The uniform rate of call for the VAT resource is 0,30 % whilst that for the GNI resource is 0,7481 %. Traditional own resources (customs duties and sugar levies) account for 11,92 % of the financing of the budget for 2015. The VAT resource accounts for 12,93 % and the GNI resource for 74,04 %. Other revenue for this financial year is estimated at EUR 1 575 497 557.
The own resources needed to finance the 2015 budget account for 1,00 % of the total GNI, thus falling below the ceiling of 1,23 % of GNI calculated using the method set out in Article 3(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (OJ L 163, 23.6.2007, p. 17).
The tables below set out step by step the method used to calculate the financing of the 2015 budget.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 752/2014
of 24 June 2014
replacing Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

The products of plant and animal origin to which the maximum residue levels of pesticides (‘MRLs’) set by Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 apply, subject to the provisions of that Regulation, are listed in Annex I to that Regulation.


(1)

Additional information should be provided by Annex I to that Regulation as regards the products concerned, in particular as regards the synonyms used to indicate the products and the scientific names of the species to which the products belong.


(2)

In the interest of clarity, the structure of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should be modified by dividing that Annex into two parts. The first part should list the products of plant and animal origin to which MRLs apply, while the second part should list the other products to which the same MRLs apply, as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.


(3)

In view of the possible future setting of MRLs for processed food products, as referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, a new entry should be added to Part A of Annex I to that Regulation, covering those products.


(4)

As a consequence of the new structure of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the footnotes of that Annex should be adapted and, where necessary, deleted in order to prevent redundancy.


(5)

Through the World Trade Organisation, the trading partners of the Union were consulted and their comments have been taken into account.


(6)

Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.


(7)

The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2015.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Article 39 of Protocol 3 provides that the Joint Committee provided for in Article 30 of the Agreement may decide to amend the provisions of this protocol.


(3)

The Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (3) (‘the Convention’), aims to replace the protocols on rules of origin currently in force among the countries of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean area with a single legal act.


(4)

The EU and Iceland signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and 30 June 2011, respectively.


(5)

The EU and Iceland deposited their instruments of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 12 March 2012, respectively. Consequently, in application of its Article 10(3), the Convention entered into force in relation to the EU and Iceland on 1 May 2012.


(6)

The Convention has included participants in the Stabilisation and Association Process in the pan-Euro-Mediterranean zone of cumulation of origin.


(7)

Where the transition towards the Convention is not simultaneous for all Contracting Parties within the cumulation zone, it should not lead to any less favourable situation than previously under the Protocol.


(8)

Protocol 3 to the Agreement should therefore be amended so as to make reference to the Convention,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Protocol 3 to the Agreement, concerning the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation shall be replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Decision.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 680/2014
of 16 April 2014
laying down implementing technical standards with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(5); the fourth subparagraph of Article 99(6); the third subparagraph of Article 101(4); the third subparagraph of Article 394(4); the fourth subparagraph of Article 415(3) and the third subparagraph of Article 430(2) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

Without prejudice to the competent authorities' powers under Article 104 (1) (j) of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), with a view to increasing efficiency and reducing the administrative burden, a coherent reporting framework should be established on the basis of a harmonised set of standards.


(2)

The provisions in this Regulation are closely linked, since they deal with institutions' reporting requirements. To ensure coherence between those provisions, which should enter into force at the same time, and to facilitate a comprehensive view and compact access to them by persons subject to those obligations, it is desirable to include all related implementing technical standards required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in a single Regulation.


(3)

The nature and complexity of institutions' activities such as trading book or non-trading book and approaches used for credit risk determine the extent of the actual reporting obligations of institutions. In addition, and in accordance with Article 99 (5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the reporting burden to institutions should be proportionate and reduced frequencies of reporting of certain templates should be introduced. Further, in order to take into account the nature, scale and complexity of institutions, template-specific materiality thresholds, should be introduced before certain reporting requirements are triggered.


(4)

Where reporting requirements are based on quantitative thresholds, in order to ensure a smooth transition to common supervisory reporting, template-specific entry and exit criteria should be introduced.


(5)

Institutions applying an accounting year that is different from the calendar year should be allowed to adjust reporting reference dates and remittance dates for reporting financial information, in order to alleviate, for such institutions, the burden of preparing the accounts for two different periods.


(6)

Financial information covers information on institutions' financial situation and potential systemic risks. The basic information on the financial situation is complemented with more detailed breakdowns to provide supervisors with information on risks of different activities. Institutions should therefore provide granular and uniform data especially on geographical and sectoral breakdowns and significant counterparties of exposures and funding in order to provide supervisory authorities with information on potential concentrations and build-ups of systemic risks.


(7)

In order to ensure consistency and comparability of information, where competent authorities require institutions to report information on own funds by using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), and extends this reporting requirement also to the reporting of financial information, institutions should report financial information in a manner similar to that of institutions preparing their consolidated accounts using IFRS, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.


(8)

Similarly, in order to ensure consistency and comparability of information, where competent authorities require institutions using national accounting standards to report financial information by virtue of Article 99 (6), these institutions should report financial information in a manner similar to that of institutions using IFRS, as applicable under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002, for reporting adjusted based on national accounting standards.


(9)

As there is a multitude of different reporting requirements at national and Union level for purposes other than those established by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, such as statistical data, monetary data, Pillar II data any rules on the common supervisory reporting can only be part of an overall reporting framework. Using one IT solution which applies to the overall reporting framework is more cost efficient compared to specifying different IT solutions for individual parts of that overall reporting framework. In order to avoid having to require institutions to report necessary information using one specific IT solution while applying other IT solutions for other reporting requirements, and with the view to avoiding unjustified implementation and operating costs, a Data Point Model and defined minimum precision requirements should be developed, so as to ensure that the different IT solutions in place produce harmonised data as well as reliable data quality. Further, in order to reduce the reporting burden for institutions, provided that the necessary requirements are fully met, competent authorities should be allowed to continue to define alternative presentations and data exchange formats currently also used for other reporting purposes. In that respect, competent authorities should be allowed to not require data points that can be derived from other data points included in the data point model, or data points referring to information that is already collected by the competent authority.


(10)

Given the novelty of reporting requirements in some jurisdictions in relation to financial information and in relation to liquidity reporting requirements, and with the view to providing institutions with adequate time to implement those requirements in a manner that will produce data of high quality, a deferred application date should apply in relation to those reporting requirements.


(11)

Given the first time application of common supervisory reporting in the Union and the need for institutions to adapt their reporting and IT systems to the common supervisory reporting requirements, institutions should have longer remittance dates for monthly reports during the first year of application of the common supervisory reporting.


(12)

This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.


(13)

The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4),

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

DECISION No 466/2014/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 16 April 2014
granting an EU guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under financing operations supporting investment projects outside the Union
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas

(1)

In addition to its core mission of financing investment in the European Union, which remains its main task and objective, the European Investment Bank (EIB) undertakes financing operations outside the Union in support of the Union's external policies. This allows the budget funds of the Union available to the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB for the benefit of the targeted third countries. In undertaking such financing operations, the EIB indirectly contributes to the general principles and policy objectives of the Union, which include reducing poverty through inclusive growth and sustainable economy, environmental and social development and the prosperity of the Union in changing global economic circumstances.


(2)

Article 209(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in conjunction with Article 208 thereof, provides that the EIB is to contribute, under the terms laid down in its Statute, to the implementation of the measures necessary to further the objectives of Union development cooperation policy.


(3)

With a view to supporting Union external action, and in order to enable the EIB to finance investments outside the Union without affecting the credit standing of the EIB, the majority of its operations outside the Union have benefited from an EU budgetary guarantee (‘EU guarantee’) administered by the Commission. This further supports EIB's creditworthiness towards the financial markets, which is of primary importance.


(4)

The latest EU guarantee for EIB financing operations signed during the period from 1 February 2007 to 31 December 2013 was established by Decision No 1080/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). An EU guarantee for EIB financing operations outside the Union in support of Union policies should be established for the 2014-20 multiannual financial framework.


(5)

The Guarantee Fund for external actions (‘Guarantee Fund’), established by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009 (3), provides a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred on EIB financing operations and on macro-financial assistance and Euratom loans outside the Union.


(6)

A list of countries potentially eligible for EIB financing under the EU guarantee should be established. It is also appropriate to establish a list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing under the EU guarantee.


(7)

Bhutan should be added to the list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing and Myanmar/Burma should be added to both lists following the recent developments which allowed the Union to open a new chapter in its relations with Bhutan and Myanmar/Burma in order to support the ongoing political and economic reforms in both countries.


(8)

In order to reflect significant policy developments, the list of countries actually eligible for EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee should be reviewed as appropriate and the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to Annex III to this Decision. The Commission's amendments to Annex III should be based on an overall assessment including economic, social, environmental and political aspects, in particular those related to the democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of all relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.


(9)

In order to cater for the potential evolution of the actual provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund in accordance with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, the maximum ceiling of the EU guarantee should be broken down into a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 27 000 000 000 and an optional additional amount of EUR 3 000 000 000. The provisioning of the Guarantee Fund in the general budget of the Union (budget line 01 03 06) is made ex-post on the basis of the outturn figures for outstanding guaranteed external lending at the end of year n-2. In view of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, ‘reflows’ deriving from Mediterranean risk capital and loan investments under operations concluded before 2007 using Union budget funds have been accumulated in a fiduciary account established for the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP). Part of these reflows should be used for the Guarantee Fund as an exceptional measure to ensure that the ceilings of EIB financing operations under this Decision are sustained at an appropriate level for the 2014-20 period. The remaining funds should be returned to the general budget of the Union.


(10)

Issues to be considered for the activation, in whole or in part, of the optional additional amount should include: progress in the implementation of this Decision by the EIB, in particular the results of EIB operations based on information from, amongst others, the Results Measurement framework (REM), including the development impact; the provisioning needs of the Guarantee Fund taking into account past and future outstanding amounts on all activities covered by the Guarantee Fund; the macroeconomic, financial and political situation of the eligible regions and countries at the time of the mid-term review.


(11)

The amounts covered by the EU guarantee in each region should continue to represent ceilings for the EIB financing under the EU guarantee and not targets that the EIB is required to meet. The ceilings should be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of this Decision, in particular in light of possible changes to the list of regions and countries actually eligible for EIB financing.


(12)

EIB financing operations should be consistent with the beneficiary country's own strategies. Against this background, in order to enhance the coherence and the focus of the EIB external financing activity on supporting Union policies, and for the maximum benefit of beneficiaries, Decision No 1080/2011/EU sets out general objectives for EIB financing operations across all eligible regions and countries, i.e. local private sector development, in particular in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), social and economic infrastructure and climate change mitigation and adaptation, building on the comparative strengths of the EIB in areas where it has a well-proven track record. These objectives should be maintained in this Decision to further promote sustainable growth and job creation.


(13)

Improving access to financing for SMEs, including SMEs from the Union investing in the regions covered by this Decision, can play an essential role in stimulating economic development and in combating unemployment. In order to effectively reach out to SMEs, the EIB financing operations should be result-oriented. The EIB should, where possible, invest in research and innovation by SMEs as a means of supporting local development. The EIB should cooperate with local financial intermediary institutions in the eligible countries, which should be integrated into the local economy, in particular to ensure that part of the financial benefits is passed on to their clients and that added value is provided compared to other sources of finance. The EIB should also, as far as possible, increase the diversification of its financial partners in the countries in which it operates. During its due diligence, the EIB should assess if financing operations supporting SMEs via a financial intermediary are in line with the regional technical operational guidelines, the REM and the EIB standards. The EIB should establish a reporting mechanism to make sure that the funds dedicated to SMEs are used for their benefit. A consolidated report on SMEs financing under this Decision should be provided by the EIB as part of its contribution to the mid-term review.


(14)

The coverage of the EU guarantee, which is limited to risks of a sovereign and political nature, is not sufficient in itself to ensure a meaningful EIB activity in support of micro-finance. Therefore such activity, where appropriate, should be carried out in connection with budgetary resources available under other instruments and via intermediary institutions including at local level as a means to promote growth and contribute indirectly to reducing poverty in poorer countries.


(15)

The EIB should continue to finance investment projects in the areas of social, environmental, and economic infrastructure, including transport and energy, and should consider increasing its activity in support of health and education infrastructure when there is clear added value in doing so.


(16)

To reinforce the climate change dimension of the EU guarantee, an overall volume of operations target and a system allowing to ex-ante assess greenhouse gas emissions of projects supported under the EU guarantee should be introduced. EIB financing operations in support of climate change mitigation and adaptation should represent at least 25 % of total EIB financing operations in order to further the promotion of the Union's climate goals on a global scale. The EIB should provide its technical expertise in cooperation with the Commission to support public and private counterparties benefitting from EIB financing operations in order to address the challenge of climate change and to make the best possible use of available financing. Concessional funding should be available for mitigation and adaptation projects. EIB financing operations should, where possible and appropriate, be complemented by funds from the general budget of the Union through the efficient and appropriate blending of grants and loans for climate change financing in the context of Union external assistance. In this regard, the Commission's annual report to the European Parliament and the Council should contain a detailed report on the financial instruments used for financing these projects, identifying the amounts of EIB financing operations and the corresponding amounts of grants.


(17)

Within the areas covered by the general objectives, regional integration among countries, in particular economic integration between Pre-accession countries, Neighbourhood countries and the Union, should be an underlying objective for EIB financing operations. In that context, the EIB should be able to support partner countries within areas covered by the general objectives through foreign direct investments by companies from the Union that promote economic integration with the Union and that contribute to promoting technology and knowledge transfer, provided that appropriate consideration has been given during the investment projects' due diligence to minimise the risks that EIB financing operations lead to negative repercussions on employment in the Union. The EIB should also be encouraged to support foreign direct investment in partner countries by companies from the Union at its own risk, taking into account the EIB's risk-bearing capacity.


(18)

The EIB should regularly conduct ex post or mid-term evaluations of supported activities under this Decision with a view to assessing their relevance, performance and development effects and to identify aspects that could improve future activities. Such evaluations should contribute to accountability and analysis of sustainability.


(19)

The practical measures for linking the general objectives of the EU guarantee and their implementation are to be set out in regional technical operational guidelines. Such guidelines should be consistent with the wider Union regional policy framework, including the differentiation principle in the European Neighbourhood Policy. The regional technical operational guidelines should be reviewed following the adoption of this Decision and further updated following the mid-term review in order to adapt to the developments in the Union external policies and priorities. The update of the regional operational technical guidelines should, among other considerations, take into account relevant developments in the eligible countries.


(20)

In accordance with Protocol No 5 on the Statute of the European Investment Bank annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the TFEU, applications made directly to the EIB for EIB financing operations to be carried out under this Decision are to be submitted to the Commission for an opinion on the conformity with relevant Union legislation and policies. In the case of EIB financing operations falling under this Decision, where the Commission delivers a negative opinion on any such operation, that operation should not be covered by the EU guarantee.


(21)

While the EIB's strength remains its distinctive model as a publicly owned investment bank whose remit is that of providing long-term lending so as to meet the policy goals set by its shareholders, EIB financing operations should contribute to the general principles guiding Union external action, as referred to in Article 21 TEU, of consolidating and supporting democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to the implementation of international commitments and agreements, including environmental agreements to which the Union is a party. In particular, the EIB should contribute to economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries in accordance with Article 212 TFEU. Furthermore, EIB actions should be in line with international law, including respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. EIB actions should also be in line with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) at relevant stages of the project cycle. In relation to developing countries, EIB financing operations should foster their sustainable economic, social and environmental development, particularly in the most disadvantaged amongst them, their smooth and gradual integration into the world economy, as well as compliance with objectives approved by the Union in the context of the United Nations and other relevant international organisations. While contributing to the implementation of the measures necessary to further the objectives of Union development cooperation policy in accordance with Article 209(3) TFEU, the EIB should strive to support indirectly the achievement of the United Nations' 2015 Millennium Development Goals, and after 2015 the achievement of any new development targets which might modify or replace the Millennium Development Goals, in all regions where it is active.


(22)

The EIB activity under this Decision should support the implementation of the European Consensus on Development, of the Agenda for Change and of the principles of aid effectiveness outlined in the Paris Declaration of 2005, the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008 and the Busan Partnership Agreement of 2011. Furthermore, it should be coherent with the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy adopted by the Council on 25 June 2012 and international environmental agreements including biodiversity commitments. It should be implemented through a number of concrete measures, in particular by reinforcing the EIB's capacity to appraise environmental, social, development aspects of investment projects, including human rights, fundamental freedoms and conflict-related risks, and by promoting local consultation with public authorities and civil society. In this context, the EIB should implement and further develop its REM which provides a detailed set of performance indicators measuring the economic, environmental, social, and development impact of its financing operations throughout the EIB project cycle. The implementation of the REM should be evaluated as part of the mid-term review of this Decision. When carrying out due diligence in respect of an investment project, the EIB should, where appropriate and in line with the Union's social and environmental principles and international best practices, as well as Union law and the national law of the beneficiary country, require the investment project promoter to carry out local consultations and disclose their results to the public in order to take account of the impact of projects on the relevant stakeholders. The EIB should remain in communication with the project promoters and beneficiaries of the projects throughout the project programming process. Finance contracts signed during the period covered by this Decision for EIB financing operations involving public counterparties should explicitly include the possibility to suspend disbursements in case of revocation of eligibility under this Decision of the country in which the investment project takes place.


(23)

At all levels, from upstream strategic planning to downstream investment project development, it should be ensured that EIB financing operations comply with and support Union external policies and the general objectives set out in this Decision. With a view to increasing the coherence of Union external action, dialogue on policy and strategy should be further strengthened between the Commission and the EIB, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), while keeping the European Parliament and the Council duly informed. EIB offices outside the Union should whenever possible be located within Union delegations in order to foster such cooperation while sharing operating costs. The Memorandum of Understanding between the European Commission and the European Investment Bank in respect of cooperation and coordination in the regions covered by the External Mandate, which was revised in 2013 enhancing cooperation and early mutual exchange of information between the Commission, the EEAS and the EIB at operational level, should continue to be applied. Cooperation in the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding should in particular include a regular review of the application of the differentiation principle in Neighbourhood countries. It is of particular importance to have an early and systematic exchange of views between the Commission and the EIB, including the EEAS, as appropriate, in the process of preparing relevant programming documents in order to maximise synergies between their activities. The cooperation in relation to the respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms and conflict prevention issues should also be reinforced. The EIB should be encouraged to cooperate with Union delegations during the EIB project cycle.


(24)

Union external relations should be supported by several instruments in particular by Regulation (EU) No 236/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). With a view to enhancing the coherence of overall Union support in the regions concerned, opportunities should be seized to combine EIB financing with Union budgetary resources when and as appropriate, in the form of financial instruments provided for in Title VIII of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and technical assistance for project preparation and implementation, through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance II established by Regulation (EU) No 231/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), the European Neighbourhood Instrument established by Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7), the Development Cooperation Instrument established by Regulation (EU) No 233/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), the Partnership Instrument for cooperation with third countries established by Regulation (EU) No 234/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9), the Instrument for the promotion of Democracy and Human Rights worldwide established by Regulation (EU) No 235/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), the Instrument contributing to stability and peace established by Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11), and the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation established by Council Regulation (EU) No 237/2014 (12). Following Decision No 1080/2011/EU, the Commission established an EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation with a view to optimising the functioning of mechanisms for the blending of grants and loans outside the Union in particular in implementing the general budget of the Union and EIB loans respectively, and exchanging best practices on governance and on evaluation criteria at project level. The participation of the EIB and other financial institutions in blending mechanisms should be fully in line with the Union's external objectives, aid effectiveness and transparency.


(25)

In its financing operations outside the Union that fall within the scope of this Decision, the EIB should endeavour further to enhance coordination and cooperation with European and international financial institutions, in particular those participating in the EU Platform for Blending in External Cooperation. This cooperation includes, where appropriate, cooperation on sector conditionality and mutual reliance on procedures, use of co-financing and participation in global initiatives, such as those promoting aid coordination and effectiveness. Such coordination and cooperation should strive to minimise possible duplication of costs and unnecessary overlap. Cooperation should be based on the principle of reciprocity. Reciprocal access by the EIB to financial instruments set up by other European and international financial institutions should be promoted, as appropriate. The tripartite memorandum of understanding between the Commission, the EIB Group and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in respect of cooperation outside the Union, which allows the EIB Group and the EBRD to act in a complementary way by relying on their respective comparative advantages, was updated in 2012 to cover the extension of EBRD's geographical scope to the Mediterranean region and should continue to be applied. The principles set out in this Decision should also be applied when EIB financing is implemented through cooperation agreements with other European and international financial institutions.


(26)

The EIB should be encouraged to continue to finance operations outside the Union also at its own risk, including in support of Union economic interests, in countries and in favour of investment projects having a sufficient creditworthiness according to the assessment of the EIB and taking into account its own risk absorption capacity, so that the use of the EU guarantee can be focused on countries and investment projects where the EU guarantee provides added value on the basis of EIB own assessment, including in terms of sustainable economic, social and environmental development.


(27)

The EIB should expand the range of innovative financial instruments it offers, including by focusing more on developing guarantee instruments. Moreover, the EIB should actively seek to participate in risk sharing instruments and debt capital market financing of projects with stable and predictable cash flow generation. In particular, it should consider supporting debt capital market instruments issued or granted for the benefit of an investment project carried out in the eligible countries. In addition, the EIB should increase its provision of loans in local currencies and issue bonds in local markets, provided that beneficiary countries put in place the necessary structural reforms, in particular in the financial sector, as well as other measures to facilitate EIB activities. In the diversification and expansion of capital market instruments, special care should be taken to ensure that such instruments do not lead to risky financial practices and indebtedness and therefore could threaten financial stability.

The Commission should report annually to the European Parliament and the Council. The report should assess EIB financing operations and their compliance with this Decision, their added value and contribution to the Union external policies, their quality, their development impact drawing on the EIB's REM and the financial benefits transferred to beneficiaries. The report should also include information on calls on the EU guarantee, on climate change and biodiversity financing under this Decision, on the follow-up of the functioning of the Memorandum of Understanding between the EIB and the European Ombudsman, and a description of the cooperation with the Commission and other European and international financial institutions, including co-financing. The report should be made public in order to allow relevant stakeholders, including civil society, to express their views.


(29)

The EIB financing operations in support of Union external policies should continue to be conducted in accordance with the principles of sound banking practice. They should continue to be managed in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, which should reflect those principles, including appropriate control measures and compliance with the EIB's statement on social and environmental standards, as well as with the relevant rules and procedures concerning the Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). In its financing operations the EIB should adequately implement its policies towards weakly regulated or non-cooperative jurisdictions identified as such by the Union, the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the Financial Action Task Force in order to contribute to the international fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and money-laundering. In the interests of transparency, the EIB should draw up, to the extent possible, in cooperation with the local financial intermediaries, a list of the final borrowers.


(30)

The EIB should take appropriate measures ensuring that, when financing operations subject to the EU guarantee, the financial interests of the Union are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption, money laundering and any other illegal activities and that OLAF is entitled to conduct on-the-spot checks and inspections in the premises of the beneficiaries. The EIB should, in line with its Policy on preventing and deterring prohibited conduct in European Investment Bank activities (the ‘EIB anti-fraud policy’), which was adopted in 2008 and revised in 2013, cooperate closely with the competent Union and Member States' authorities in order to strengthen the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing measures in force and help improve their enforcement. In line with its Whistleblowing Policy, the EIB should also pay particular attention to information by whistleblowers regarding potential cases of fraud, corruption or other illegal activity, allowing for a proper follow-up, feedback and protection against retaliation.


(31)

The EIB governing bodies should be encouraged to take the necessary measures to adapt the EIB activity to contribute to the Union's external policies in an effective manner, and to adequately meet the requirements set out in this Decision,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
EU guarantee
1.   The Union shall grant the European Investment Bank (EIB) a budgetary guarantee for financing operations carried out outside the Union (‘EU guarantee’). The EU guarantee shall be granted as a global guarantee in respect of payments due to the EIB, but not received by it, in connection with loans, loan guarantees, and debt capital market instruments granted for or issued for the benefit of EIB investment projects that are eligible in accordance with paragraph 2.
2.   Eligible for the EU guarantee shall be the EIB loans, loan guarantees, and debt capital market instruments that are granted for or issued for the benefit of investment projects carried out in eligible countries in accordance with the EIB's own rules and procedures, including the EIB's statement on environmental and social principles and standards, and in support of the relevant Union external policy objectives, where EIB financing has been granted in accordance with a signed agreement which has neither expired nor been cancelled (‘EIB financing operations’).
3.   The EIB financing operations in support of Union external policies shall continue to be managed in accordance with the principles of sound banking practices.
4.   The EU guarantee shall be restricted to 65 % of the aggregate amount disbursed and guaranteed under EIB financing operations, less amounts reimbursed, plus all related amounts.
5.   The EU guarantee shall cover EIB financing operations signed during the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020.
6.   If, on expiry of the period referred to in paragraph 5, the European Parliament and the Council have not adopted a decision granting a new EU guarantee to the EIB against losses under its financing operations outside the Union, that period shall be automatically extended once by six months.
Article 2
Ceilings for EIB financing operations under EU guarantee
1.   The maximum ceiling of the EIB financing operations under EU guarantee throughout the period 2014-20 shall not exceed EUR 30 000 000 000. Amounts initially earmarked for financing operations but subsequently cancelled shall not count against the ceiling.
This maximum ceiling shall be broken down into:

(a)

a fixed ceiling of a maximum amount of EUR 27 000 000 000;


(b)

an optional additional amount of EUR 3 000 000 000.

The European Parliament and the Council shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on the activation in whole or in part of the amount referred to in point (b) and its regional distribution following the mid-term review as set out in Article 19.
2.   The fixed ceiling referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be broken down into regional ceilings and sub-ceilings as laid down in Annex I. Within the regional ceilings, the EIB shall progressively ensure a balanced country distribution within the regions covered by the EU guarantee.
Article 3
General objectives and principles
1.   The EU guarantee shall be granted only for EIB financing operations which have added value on the basis of the EIB's own assessment, and support any of the following general objectives:

(a)

local private sector development, in particular support to SMEs;


(b)

development of social and economic infrastructure, including transport, energy, environmental infrastructure, and information and communication technology;


(c)

climate change mitigation and adaptation.

2.   Whilst preserving the EIB's distinct character as an investment bank, EIB financing operations carried out under this Decision shall contribute to the general EU interest, in particular the principles guiding Union external action, as referred to in Article 21 TEU and shall contribute to the implementation of international environmental agreements to which the Union is a party. The EIB governing bodies are encouraged to take the necessary measures to adapt the EIB activity to contribute to the Union external policies in an effective manner, and to adequately meet the requirements set out in this Decision.
3.   Regional integration among countries, including in particular economic integration between Pre-accession countries, Neighbourhood countries and the Union, shall be an underlying objective for EIB financing operations within areas covered by the general objectives set out in paragraph 1. The EIB shall undertake financing operations in beneficiary countries within areas covered by the general objectives by supporting foreign direct investments that promote economic integration with the Union.
4.   In developing countries, as defined in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development list of official development assistance recipients, the EIB financing operations shall contribute, in accordance with Articles 208 and 209 TFEU, indirectly to the objectives of the Union development cooperation policy, such as reducing poverty through inclusive growth and sustainable economy, environmental and social development.
5.   To ensure that private sector investments have the greatest development impact, the EIB shall endeavour to strengthen the local private sector in beneficiary countries through support to local investment as provided for in point (a) of paragraph 1. EIB financing operations supporting the general objectives set out in paragraph 1 shall endeavour to also include support to investment projects by SMEs from the Union. In order to effectively monitor the use of funds for the benefit of the SMEs concerned, the EIB shall establish adequate contractual requirements with financial intermediaries, including standards for reporting to be provided by the beneficiaries.
The EIB shall cooperate with financial intermediaries that can support the specific needs of SMEs in the countries of operation and that do not participate in EIB financing operations implemented in an eligible country through vehicles located in a foreign non-cooperative jurisdiction referred to in Article 13.
6.   EIB financing operations supporting the general objective set out in point (b) of paragraph 1 shall support investment projects predominantly in the areas of transport, energy, environmental infrastructure, information and communication technology, health and education. This includes production and integration of energy from renewable sources, energy systems transformation enabling a switch to lower carbon intensive technologies and fuels, sustainable energy security and energy infrastructure, including for gas production and transportation to Union energy market, as well as electrification of rural areas, environmental infrastructure such as water and sanitation and green infrastructure, telecommunications and broadband network infrastructure.
7.   EIB financing operations supporting the general objectives set out in point (c) of paragraph 1 shall support investment projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation which contribute to the overall objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in particular by avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the areas of renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transport, or by increasing resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries, sectors and communities. The eligibility criteria for climate action projects are defined in the EIB climate change strategy which shall be updated before the end of 2015. To this end, an analysis of the carbon footprint ought to be included in the environmental assessment procedure to determine whether project proposals optimise energy-efficiency improvements. Over the period covered by this Decision, the volume of those operations shall represent at least 25 % of total EIB financing operations.
8.   In line with Union and international climate change objectives, before the end of 2015 the EIB, in cooperation with the Commission, shall update its climate change strategy as regards EIB financing operations. This update shall, inter alia, integrate concrete actions to ensure that investment projects under this Decision are in line with Union's climate change objectives and to step up efforts to support renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.
9.   The EU guarantee shall cover only EIB financing operations carried out in eligible countries that have concluded a framework agreement with the EIB establishing the legal conditions under which such operations are to be carried out.
Article 4
Countries covered
1.   The list of countries potentially eligible for EIB financing under EU guarantee is set out in Annex II. The list of countries eligible for EIB financing under EU guarantee is set out in Annex III and shall include no countries other than those listed in Annex II. For countries not listed in Annex II, eligibility for EIB financing under the EU guarantee shall be decided on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.
2.   The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 18 concerning amendments to Annex III. The Commission's decisions shall be based on an overall assessment, including economic, social, environmental and political aspects, in particular those related to the democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the relevant European Parliament resolutions and Council decisions and conclusions.
3.   Delegated acts amending Annex III shall not affect the EU guarantee coverage of EIB financing operations signed before the entry into force of those delegated acts, subject to paragraph 4.
4.   Disbursements on EIB financing operations benefiting from a Comprehensive Guarantee as referred to in Article 8(1) shall not be made in countries not listed in Annex III.
5.   The EU guarantee shall not cover EIB financing operations in a specific country with which the agreement concerning such operations has been signed after that country's accession to the Union.
Article 5
Contribution of EIB financing operations to Union policies
1.   The Commission shall update, together with the EIB, the existing regional technical operational guidelines for EIB financing operations within one year following the entry into force of this Decision.
The regional technical operational guidelines shall be consistent with the wider Union regional policy framework set out in Annex IV. In particular, the regional technical operational guidelines shall ensure that EIB financing under this Decision is complementary to corresponding Union assistance policies, programmes and instruments in the different regions.
In updating the regional technical operational guidelines, the Commission and the EIB shall take into account relevant European Parliament resolutions and Council decisions and conclusions. The regional technical operational guidelines shall be consistent with the priorities contained in the national or regional programmes, where available, drawn up by the beneficiary countries, taking due account of any consultation with local civil society in the process of drawing up those programmes.
The Commission shall transmit to the European Parliament and to the Council the updated regional technical operational guidelines, as soon as they are established.
Within the framework set out by the regional technical operational guidelines, the EIB shall define corresponding financing strategies and ensure their implementation.
EIB financing operations shall be consistent with the regional technical operational guidelines and the strategies of the beneficiary country.
The regional technical operational guidelines shall be reviewed following the mid-term review referred to in Article 19.
2.   Within the framework of the procedure provided for in Article 19 of Protocol No 5, the Commission delivers an opinion on EIB financing operations. In the case of EIB financing operations falling under this Decision, where the Commission delivers an unfavourable opinion, that operation shall not be covered by the EU guarantee.
Article 6
Cooperation with the Commission and the EEAS
1.   The consistency of EIB external actions with Union external policy objectives shall be further strengthened, with a view to maximising synergies between EIB financing operations and Union budgetary resources, in particular through the updating of the regional technical operational guidelines referred to in Article 5, for which the EEAS shall be consulted on policy issues, as appropriate, as well as through regular and systematic dialogue and early exchange of information on:

(a)

strategic documents prepared by the Commission or the EEAS as appropriate, such as country and regional strategy papers, indicative programmes, action plans and pre-accession documents;


(b)

the EIB's strategic planning documents, investment project pipelines and EIB annual reporting to the Commission;

Article 7
Cooperation with other European and international financial institutions
1.   EIB financing operations shall be carried out, where appropriate, in cooperation with other European multilateral and Member States' financial institutions (‘European financial institutions’) and international financial institutions, including regional development banks (‘international financial institutions’) in order to maximise synergies, cooperation and efficiency, to develop jointly innovative financial instruments, to ensure prudent and reasonable sharing of risks and coherent investment project and sector conditionality, and in order to minimise possible duplication of costs and unnecessary overlap.
2.   The cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be facilitated by coordination between the Commission, the EIB and the relevant European and international financial institutions operating in the different regions, carried out where appropriate in the context of memoranda of understanding or other Union regional cooperation frameworks.

2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1, Palestine is represented by the Palestinian Authority and Kosovo (13) is represented by the Authorities of Kosovo.
3.   For EIB financing operations other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the EU guarantee shall cover all payments due to the EIB but not received by it, where the non-receipt has been caused by the realisation of one of the following political risks (‘Political Risk Guarantee’):

(a)

non-transfer of currency;


(b)

expropriation;

war or civil disturbance;


(d)

denial of justice upon breach of contract.

The allocation policy shall be based on the creditworthiness of EIB financing operations as assessed by the EIB, the ceilings as defined in Annex I, the nature of the counterparty, whether a sovereign State or a sub-sovereign entity falling under paragraph 1 of this Article or a private entity, EIB risk absorption capacity and other relevant criteria, including added value of the EU guarantee. The European Parliament and the Council shall be informed on the allocation policy in accordance with Article 14.
7.   When the EU guarantee is called, the Union shall be subrogated to any relevant rights of the EIB in respect of any obligation in connection to its financing operations, in accordance with the guarantee agreement referred to in Article 14.
Article 9
EIB assessment and monitoring of investment projects
1.   The EIB shall carry out thorough due diligence and, where appropriate, shall require project promoters to carry out local public consultation, in line with Union social and environmental principles, with the relevant national and local stakeholders, as well as with civil society, at project planning stage and implementation stage on social, human rights, environmental, economic and development-related aspects of investment projects covered by the EU guarantee, and to provide information relevant for the assessment of the contribution to the fulfilment of Union external policy and strategic objectives.
Where appropriate, this appraisal shall include an assessment of how the capacities of the beneficiaries of EIB financing can be reinforced throughout the project cycle with technical assistance. The EIB's own rules and procedures shall include the necessary provisions on assessment of environmental and social impact of investment projects and of aspects related to human rights and conflict prevention, to ensure that investment projects supported under this Decision are environmentally and socially sustainable.
2.   In addition to the ex-ante assessment of development-related aspects, the EIB shall monitor the implementation of financing operations. In particular, it shall require the project promoters to carry out thorough monitoring during project implementation until completion, inter alia, on the economic, development, social, environmental and human rights impact of the investment project. The EIB shall verify on a regular basis the information provided by the project promoters and make it publicly available if the project promoter agrees.

ANNEX IV
REGIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK
EIB activity in partners participating in the pre-accession process takes place in the framework established in the Accession and European Partnerships which set out the priorities for candidates and potential candidates with a view to making progress in moving closer to the Union, and which provide a framework for Union assistance. The Stabilisation and Association Process is the Union policy framework for the Western Balkans. It is based on progressive partnership, in which the Union offers trade concessions, economic and financial assistance and contractual relationships through Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Pre-accession financial assistance helps the candidates and potential candidates prepare for the obligations and challenges of membership of the Union. This assistance supports the reform process, including preparations for eventual membership. It focuses on institution-building, alignment with the acquis of the Union, preparation for Union policies and instruments and promotion of measures to achieve economic convergence.
EIB activity in Neighbourhood countries takes place in the framework of the new European Neighbourhood Policy set out in the Joint Communication entitled ‘A new response to a changing Neighbourhood’, adopted by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission on 25 May 2011, and the Council conclusions adopted on 20 June 2011, which calls notably for greater support to partners committed to building democratic societies and undertaking reforms, in line with the ‘more for more’ and ‘mutual accountability’ principles, and provides the strategic policy framework for the Union relations with the neighbours. In the framework of this cooperation, EIB financing under this Decision will also be targeted at policies promoting inclusive growth and job creation contributing to social stability in line with an incentive-based approach supporting Union external policy objectives, including in relation to migration issues.
In order to achieve these objectives the Union and its partners implement jointly agreed bilateral action plans defining a set of priorities including on political and security issues, trade and economic matters, environmental and social concerns and integration of transport and energy networks.
The Union for the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership, the Black Sea Synergy, the Union Strategy for the Danube Region and the Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region are multilateral and regional initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between the Union and the respective group of Neighbourhood partner countries facing common challenges and/or sharing a common geographical environment. The Union for the Mediterranean aims to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean integration process by supporting mutual economic, social and environmental development on both sides of the Mediterranean and supports improved socioeconomic development, solidarity, regional integration, sustainable development and knowledge building, underlining the need to increase financial cooperation to support regional and trans-national projects. The Union for the Mediterranean supports, in particular, the creation of maritime and land highways, the de-pollution of the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean solar energy plan, the Mediterranean Business Development Initiative, civil protection initiatives and the Euro-Mediterranean university.
The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. The Eastern Partnership will provide additional impetus to the economic and social and regional development of the partner countries. It will facilitate good governance, including in the financial sector, promote regional development and social cohesion and help to reduce partner countries' socioeconomic disparities.
The Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region supports a sustainable environment and optimal economic and social development in the Baltic Sea region. The Union Strategy for the Danube Region supports, in particular, the development of transport, energy connections and security, sustainable environment and socioeconomic development in the Danube region. The Eastern Partnership aims to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the Union and Eastern partner countries. Russia and the Union have a wide-ranging strategic partnership, distinct from the European Neighbourhood Policy and expressed through the Common Spaces and Roadmaps. These are complemented at multilateral level by the Northern Dimension which provides a framework for cooperation between the Union, Russia, Norway and Iceland (Belarus, Canada and the United States are observers to the Northern Dimension).
EIB activity in Latin America takes place in the framework of the Union, Latin America and the Caribbean Strategic Partnership. As highlighted in the 30 September 2009 Commission Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ‘The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership’, the Union's priorities in the field of cooperation towards Latin America are the promotion of regional integration and the eradication of poverty and social inequality in order to promote sustainable economic and social development. These policy objectives will be fostered taking into account the different level of development of Latin American countries. Bilateral dialogue and cooperation will be pursued in areas of common interest for both regions, including environment, climate change, disaster risk reduction and energy, science, research, higher education, technology and innovation.
In Asia, the Union is deepening its strategic partnerships with China and India and negotiations are progressing on new partnership and free trade agreements with South-East Asian countries. At the same time, development cooperation remains high on the Union's agenda with Asia; the Union development strategy for the Asian region aims at eradicating poverty by supporting broad-based sustainable economic growth, promoting a conducive environment and conditions for trade and integration within the region, enhancing governance, increasing political and social stability, and supporting the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals. Policies are being put in place jointly to address common challenges, such as climate change, sustainable development, security and stability, governance and human rights, as well as the prevention of, and response to, natural and humanitarian disasters.
The Union Strategy for a new partnership with Central Asia adopted by the European Council of 21-22 June 2007 has strengthened regional and bilateral dialogue and Union cooperation with Central Asian countries on major issues facing the region, such as poverty reduction, sustainable development and stability. The implementation of the strategy has brought about important advances in the fields of human rights, the rule of law, good governance and democracy, education, economic development, trade and investment, energy and transport and environmental policies.
EIB activity in South Africa takes place in the framework of the Joint EU Country Strategy Paper for South Africa. The main focal areas identified in that Strategy Paper are employment creation and capacity development for service delivery and social cohesion. EIB activities in South Africa have taken place in high complementarity with the Union development cooperation programme, namely through the EIB focus on private sector support and investments in expansion of infrastructure and social services (housing, electric power, drinking water purification and municipal infrastructure). The mid-term review of the EU Country Strategy Paper for South Africa conducted in 2009-10 has proposed the strengthening of actions in the area of climate-change through activities supporting the creation of green jobs. For the period 2014-20, EIB activity is expected to support in a complementary fashion Union external cooperation policies, programmes and instruments by continuing to focus on key EU-South Africa priorities in order to promote equitable and sustainable economic growth, contribute to employment creation and capacity development, and support the sustainable provision and equitable access to basic infrastructure and services.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 355/2014
of 8 April 2014
amending Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (1), and in particular Article 33(3) and Article 38(d) thereof,
Whereas:

(1)

Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 (2) sets out the list of control bodies and control authorities competent to carry out controls and issue certificates in third countries for the purpose of equivalence. In the light of new information received by the Commission from control bodies and control authorities listed in that Annex, certain changes should be made in the list.


(2)

The Commission has examined requests for inclusion in the list set out in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008, received by 31 October 2012 and by 31 October 2013. Control bodies and control authorities in respect of which the subsequent examination of all information received led to the conclusion that they complied with the relevant requirements should be included in that list.


(3)

Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 provides that the list of recognised control bodies and control authorities shall contain all the information necessary in respect of each control body and control authority to allow verifying whether products placed on the Union market have been controlled by a control body or control authority recognised in accordance with Article 33(3) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. In accordance with Article 12(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 ‘Institut für Marktökologie (IMO)’ notified the Commission of the change of its name to ‘IMO Swiss AG’, effective from 1 January 2013. This change should be included in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.


(4)

As provided for in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 586/2013 (3), the deadline for submission of the annual reports for 2012 by control bodies and control authorities was 30 April 2013. ‘Center of Organic Agriculture in Egypt’ did not send its annual report by that date. The Commission granted an additional period to ‘Center of Organic Agriculture in Egypt’ for submitting its annual report but it did not receive that report by 4 November 2013 either. In view of that, in accordance with Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 ‘Center of Organic Agriculture in Egypt’ should be withdrawn from the list in Annex IV thereto.


(5)

Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.


(6)

The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF “ORIGINATING PRODUCTS”

Article 2
General requirements
1.   For the purpose of implementing the Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the EEA:

(a)

products wholly obtained in the EEA within the meaning of Article 4;


(b)

products obtained in the EEA incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the EEA within the meaning of Article 5.

For this purpose, the territories of the Contracting Parties to which the Agreement applies, shall be considered as a single territory.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the territory of the Principality of Liechtenstein shall be excluded from that of the EEA, for the purpose of determining the origin of the products referred to in Tables I and II of Protocol 3 and such products shall be considered to be originating in the EEA only if they have been either wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in the territories of the other Contracting Parties.
Article 3
Diagonal cumulation of origin
1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2, products shall be considered as originating in the EEA if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein) (1), Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Turkey, the European Union or in any participant in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association Process (2), provided that the working or processing carried out in the EEA goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.
2.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2, products shall be considered as originating in the EEA if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in any country which is a participant in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, based on the Barcelona Declaration adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held on 27 and 28 November 1995, other than Turkey (3), provided that the working or processing carried out in the EEA goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.
3.   Where the working or processing carried out in the EEA does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 6, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the EEA only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the EEA.
4.   Products, originating in one of the countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, which do not undergo any working or processing in the EEA shall retain their origin if exported into one of these countries.
5.   The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that:

(a)

a preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination;


(b)

materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol;
and


(c)

notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in the other Contracting Parties according to their own procedures.

The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series).
The European Union shall provide the other Contracting Parties, through the European Commission, with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.
Article 4
Wholly obtained products
1.   The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the EEA:

(a)

mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;


(b)

vegetable products harvested there;


(c)

live animals born and raised there;


(d)

products from live animals raised there;


(e)

products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;


(f)

products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Contracting Parties by their vessels;


(g)

products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f);


(h)

used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;


(i)

waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;


(j)

products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;


(k)

goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j).

2.   The terms “their vessels” and “their factory ships” in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

(a)

which are registered or recorded in a Member State of the European Union or in an EFTA State;


(b)

which sail under the flag of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State;


(c)

which are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State, or by a company with its head office in one of these States, of which the manager or managers, Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States;


(d)

of which the master and officers are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State;
and


(e)

of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State.

Article 5
Sufficiently worked or processed products
1.   For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained shall considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled.
The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
2.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

(a)

their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product;


(b)

any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph.

This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.
3.   Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6.
Article 6
Insufficient working or processing
1.   Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied:

(a)

preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage;


(b)

breaking-up and assembly of packages;


(c)

washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings;


(d)

(e)

simple painting and polishing operations;


(f)

husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice;

(i)

sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting;

sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles);


(k)

simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations;


(l)

affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;


(m)

simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds;


(n)

mixing of sugar with any material;


(o)

simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts;


(p)

a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (o);


(q)

slaughter of animals.

2.   All operations carried out in the EEA on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1.
Article 7
Unit of qualification
1.   The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.
It follows that:

(a)

when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;


(b)

when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.

2.   Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.
Article 8
Accessories, spare parts and tools
Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.
Article 9
Sets
Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.
Article 10
Neutral elements
In order to determine whether a product is an originating product, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture:

(a)

energy and fuel;


(b)

plant and equipment;


(c)

machines and tools;


(d)

goods which neither enter into the final composition of the product nor are intended to do so.

TITLE III

TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS

Article 11
Principle of territoriality
1.   Except as provided for in Article 3 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the EEA.
2.   Except as provided for in Article 3, where originating goods exported from the EEA to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a)

the returning goods are the same as those exported;
and


(b)

they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.

3.   The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the EEA on materials exported from the EEA and subsequently reimported there, provided:

(a)

the said materials are wholly obtained in the EEA or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 prior to being exported;
and


(b)

it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(i)

the reimported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials;
and


(ii)

the total added value acquired outside the EEA by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.


4.   For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the EEA. However, where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incorporated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the EEA by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.
5.   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, “total added value” shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the EEA, including the value of the materials incorporated there.
6.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 5(2) is applied.
7.   The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System.
8.   Any working or processing of the kind covered by this Article and done outside the EEA shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.
Article 12
Direct transport
1.   The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products, satisfying the requirements of this Protocol, which are transported directly within the EEA or through the territories of the countries referred to in Article 3 with which cumulation is applicable. However, products constituting one single consignment may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, trans-shipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.
Originating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the EEA.
2.   Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:

(a)

a single transport document covering the passage from the exporting country through the country of transit; or


(b)

a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:

(i)

giving an exact description of the products;


(ii)

stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships, or the other means of transport used;
and


(iii)

certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country; or



(c)

failing these, any substantiating documents.

Article 13
Exhibitions
1.   Originating products, sent for exhibition in a country other than those referred to in Article 3 with which cumulation is applicable and sold after the exhibition for importation in the EEA shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a)

an exporter has consigned these products from one of the Contracting Parties to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;


(b)

the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in another Contracting Party;


(c)

the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter in the state in which they were sent for exhibition;
and


(d)

the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.

2.   A proof of origin shall be issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V and submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in the normal manner. The name and address of the exhibition shall be indicated thereon. Where necessary, additional documentary evidence of the conditions under which the products have been exhibited may be required.
3.   Paragraph 1 shall apply to any trade, industrial, agricultural or crafts exhibition, fair or similar public show or display which is not organised for private purposes in shops or business premises with a view to the sale of foreign products, and during which the products remain under customs control.
TITLE IV

DRAWBACK OR EXEMPTION

Article 14
Prohibition of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties
1.   Non-originating materials used in the manufacture of products originating in the EEA or in one of the countries referred to in Article 3 for which a proof of origin is issued or made out in accordance with the provisions of Title V shall not be subject in any of the Contracting Parties to drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties of whatever kind.
2.   The prohibition in paragraph 1 shall apply to any arrangement for refund, remission or non-payment, partial or complete, of customs duties or charges having an equivalent effect, applicable in any of the Contracting Parties to materials used in the manufacture, where such refund, remission or non-payment applies, expressly or in effect, when products obtained from the said materials are exported and not when they are retained for home use there.
3.   The exporter of products covered by a proof of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, upon request from the customs authorities, all appropriate documents proving that no drawback has been obtained in respect of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products concerned and that all customs duties or charges having equivalent effect applicable to such materials have actually been paid.
4.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3 shall also apply in respect of packaging within the meaning of Article 7(2), accessories, spare parts and tools within the meaning of Article 8 and products in a set within the meaning of Article 9 when such items are non-originating.
5.   The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall apply only in respect of materials which are of the kind to which the Agreement applies. Furthermore, they shall not preclude the application of an export refund system for agricultural products, applicable upon export in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.
TITLE V

1.   A movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.
2.   For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill in both the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED and the application form, specimens of which appear in the Annexes IIIa and b. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which the Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the forms are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters.

4.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Contracting Party in the following cases:

—

if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the EEA or in one of the countries referred to in Article 3(1) with which cumulation is applicable, without application of cumulation with materials originating in one of the countries referred to in Article 3(2), and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol,


—

if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in one of the countries referred to in Article 3(2) with which cumulation is applicable, without application of cumulation with materials originating in one of the countries referred to in Article 3 and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol, provided a certificate EUR-MED or an origin declaration EUR-MED has been issued in the country of origin.

5.   A movement certificate EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities of a Contracting Party, if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the EEA or in one of the countries referred to in Article 3 with which cumulation is applicable, fulfil the requirements of this Protocol and:

—

cumulation was applied with materials originating in one of the countries referred to in Article 3(2), or


—

the products may be used as materials in the context of cumulation for the manufacture of products for export to one of the countries referred to in Article 3(2), or


—

the products may be re-exported from the country of destination to one of the countries referred to in Article 3(2).

6.   A movement certificate EUR-MED shall contain one of the following statements in English in box 7:

For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.
8.   The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.
9.   A movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.
Article 17
Movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED issued retrospectively
1.   Notwithstanding Article 16(9), a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

(a)

it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;
or


(b)

it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2.   Notwithstanding Article 16(9), a movement certificate EUR-MED may be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates and for which a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued at the time of exportation, provided that it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that the conditions referred to in Article 16(5) are satisfied.
